J	Alpers, W; Wong, WK; Dagestad, KF; Chan, PW				Alpers, Werner; Wong, Wai Kin; Dagestad, Knut-Frode; Chan, Pak Wai			A northerly winter monsoon surge over the South China Sea studied by remote sensing and a numerical model	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING					10th Biennial Pan Ocean Remote Sensing Conference (PORSEC)	OCT, 2010	Keelung, TAIWAN	Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Taiwan Ocean Res Inst, Taiwan Natl Sci Council, Fisheries (FA), Environm Protect Agcy Taiwan (EPA), Int Space Sci & Res Agencies				A northerly winter monsoon surge, which occurred on 15 December 2009 over the South China Sea (SCS), is studied by using satellite-based and ground-based remote-sensing data and an atmospheric numerical model. The remote-sensing data are from the advanced synthetic aperture radar (ASAR) onboard the Environmental Satellite (Envisat), the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor onboard the Terra satellite, the imager onboard the geostationary satellite MTSAT-1R (Multi-Functional Transport Satellite-1R) and the weather radar of the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). A northerly winter monsoon surge is a cold air outbreak associated with a northerly wind, the passage of a cold front from north to south and a strong drop in air temperature. The analyses of the weather radar and the MTSAR-1R images of 15 December show that the surge of 15 December was associated with a rain band and a cloud front travelling over the SCS in a southeastward direction. Due to the interaction of the cold air (13 degrees C) with the warm water (19 degrees C), they dissolved when they had reached an offshore distance of approximately 160 km. The high-resolution (150 m) ASAR image reveals fine-scale features of the wind field, in particular details of the wind front, such as embedded rain cells and atmospheric gravity waves. Quantitative information on the near-surface wind field is retrieved from the ASAR, and it is shown that the wind field associated with the surge is quite variable and that speeds up to 15 m s(-1) are encountered in coastal wind jets. Finally, the remote-sensing data are compared with the simulation results of the pre-operational version of the Atmospheric Integrated Rapid-cycle (AIR) forecast model of the HKO. It is shown that, in general, the AIR model reproduces quite well the observational data.				chen, zhu/K-5923-2013; Chan, Pak Wai/C-8447-2011	Chan, Pak Wai/0000-0003-2289-0609												0143-1161						2012	33	23			SI		7361	7381		10.1080/01431161.2012.685983								WOS:000306286200004

No significant changes were found in marine phytoplankton in the first few months after the oil spill. However, a big phytoplankton bloom was observed after 10 months, when Chl-a increased from 0.1 to 1.0 mg m(-3). After considering the time-series variability of Chl-a and SST and the spatial variability of Chl-a and bathymetry, we concluded that this phytoplankton bloom was probably related to the Lebanon oil spill.				chen, zhu/K-5923-2013	Pan, Gang/0000-0003-0054-6516												0143-1161						2012	33	23			SI		7482	7490		10.1080/01431161.2012.685982								WOS:000306286200012

Revilla			Potential of remote sensing techniques for tsunami hazard and vulnerability analysis - a case study from Phang-Nga province, Thailand	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Recent tsunami disasters, such as the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami or the 2011 Japan earthquake and tsunami, have highlighted the need for effective risk management. Remote sensing is a relatively new method for risk analysis, which shows significant potential in conducting spatially explicit risk and vulnerability assessments. In order to explore and discuss the potential and limitations of remote sensing techniques, this paper presents a case study from the tsunami-affected Andaman Sea coast of Thailand. It focuses on a local assessment of tsunami hazard and vulnerability, including the socio-economic and ecological components. High resolution optical data, including IKONOS data and aerial imagery (MFC-3 camera) as well as different digital elevation models, were employed to create basic geo-data including land use and land cover (LULC), building polygons and topographic data sets and to provide input data for the hazard and vulnerability assessment. Results show that the main potential of applying remote sensing techniques and data derives from a synergistic combination with other types of data. In the case of hazard analysis, detailed LULC information and the correction of digital surface models (DSMs) significantly improved the results of inundation modeling. The vulnerability assessment showed that remote sensing can be used to spatially extrapolate field data on socio-economic or ecological vulnerability collected in the field, to regionalize exposure elements and assets and to predict vulnerable areas. Limitations and inaccuracies became evident regarding the assessment of ecological resilience and the statistical prediction of vulnerability components, based on variables derived from remote sensing data.

Although frequently criticized and despite many alternatives, due to its simplicity and intuitive manner, post-classification change detection still remains one of the most applied techniques. Many studies in the field of change detection analysis acknowledge, for instance, the impact of misregistration, inconsistencies in classification schemes or differences in methods for image interpretation. However, there are additional, rarely studied influences that can cause large errors in change detection results, including integrating multi-resolution data, the adjacency effect and the minimum mapping units (MMUs) that are applied to the classification before change detection. This study demonstrates these effects for the complex land cover of the Alvarado mangrove area at the Mexican Gulf Coast, employing 10 m Systeme Pour l'Observation de la Terre 5 (SPOT-5) high geometric resolution (HRG)-based and 57 m Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS) classifications. As a baseline, the proportion of the fine spatial resolution classes within the coarse spatial resolution cells were derived, from which proportional change matrices were computed. The analysis employs difference measures to compare change matrices and proportional maps. The impact of various tested resampling functions was negligible if coarse resolution data were refined. For coarsening fine spatial resolution data, change matrix comparison was comparatively small but yielded differences of approximately 20% in spatially explicit measures. Incorrect positional alignment indicated differences of up to 5% in the change matrix for a misregistration of 100 m and even higher spatially explicit differences (28%). The discrepancies due to the adjacency effect were rather low. MMUs of 25 ha resulted in differences of up to 36% in the change matrix. The magnitude of the discrepancies of all studied effects depends on the class diversity in the map, and some can also be related to the difference in spatial resolution.																	0143-1161						2012	33	20					6426	6445		10.1080/01431161.2012.688148								WOS:000304593100008

Chris			GIS-Based Analysis and Modeling of Coastline Advance and Retreat Along the Coast of Guyana	MARINE GEODESY												This research utilized a Geographical Information System (GIS)-based approach to analyze, map and model coastline advance and retreat. A time series (1941-1987) of empirical advance and retreat data from the coast of Guyana was used. Coastlines were also extracted from 1987, 1990 and 1992 Landsat TM images, and 1999, 2002, 2004 and 2006 Landsat ETM+ images. The historical data were used to calculate advance and retreat (AOR) rates and sediment volume changes. Distinct periods of advance and retreat matched corresponding periods of sediment gains and losses. The Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) was used to predict rates of coastline change. Graphical plots of DSAS results identified spatial and temporal phase shifts of the coastline. Recurring episodes of accretion and erosion could be associated with the presence or absence of mudbanks along the coast.					ahmad, sajid/0000-0003-0122-472X												0149-0419	1521-060X					2012	35	1					1	15		10.1080/01490419.2011.637851								WOS:000304472400001

High chlorophyll concentration (similar to 20 mg m(-3)) patches were observed. MODIS-Aqua data of January 1, 2004, were analyzed to generate normalized water leaving radiance (nLw) images for seven visible channels: 412, 443, 488, 531, 551, 667 and 678 nm. The channels 667 and 678 nm showed interesting algal bloom features. The bloom features were detected in OCM image of January 2, 2004, using Subramanian's Trichodesmium detection Protocol. MODIS-Aqua retrieved Sea Surface Temperature (SST) around the bloom patches was observed to be >240 degrees C. The OCM chlorophyll mean observed to be very high (>10.0 mg m(-3)) in two bloom pockets. Quickscat scatterometer derived wind speed was found to be optimum in the range of 3-5 m/sec.																	0149-0419						2012	35	2					158	174		10.1080/01490419.2011.637848								WOS:000304471500003

The following 13-year time series were derived from the remote-sensing, analysis and reanalysis data: maximum summertime sea surface temperature (SST), maximum sea surface temperature (MaxSST) accumulated in 5 days (SSTAc5day), diffuse attenuation coefficient for downward irradiance at 490 nm (K-490), rainfall and magnitude of surface wind fields, including the zonal (U) and meridional components. Principal component analysis, non-metric multidimensional scaling (MDS) and cluster and similarity analyses indicate the complex nature of the bleaching patterns and the influence of the strong 1997-1998 El Nino. A significant (global R-value = 0.65; p < 0.01) compounding effect of the reef location and bleaching intensity on the differentiation of bleaching environments was detected. A combination of high SSTAc5day and low K-490 may cause coral bleaching in the northernmost reefs. Evidence clearly points to a scenario where the influence of reef location, bleaching year and intensity may produce a compounded effect that determines the bleaching environments in Bahia.

Flood hazard in Wadi Rahbaa area, Egypt	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												In the last decade, attention has been devoted to the southern part of the Egyptian Red Sea coast due to the large touristic and mining activities. Egypt spares no effort to develop it, to build new urban communities, and to create new job opportunities. Many comprehensive planning studies have been conducted. Many luxurious tourist spots, airports, and harbors have been constructed. These areas are subjected to flash floods, which represent a frequent threat to these urbanization activities that may cause losses in livelihood. By analyzing the geomorphologic features of the study area, intense stream networks are detected that, with the available metrological data, require flood management and analysis to mitigate the possible negative effects and to benefit from the estimation of flood water. Rahbaa basin is a sub-catchment of wadi Hodin. Flash floods within this area threaten the Red Sea coastal plain as well as the main coastal roads. It also directly drained out to the sea, which leads to a loss of huge amounts of flood water that is useful for arid regions. Using geographic information system and remote-sensing tools with the application of a comprehensive graphical modeling (watershed modeling system) supports the hydrological modeling of HEC-1. The total amount of runoff is calculated and the hydrograph of the 50-year return period is computed using rainfall historical data.					, Hoda/0000-0003-2866-5357												1866-7511					JAN	2012	5	1					45	52		10.1007/s12517-010-0144-z								WOS:000299294800004						
J	Klemas, V				Klemas, Victor			Remote Sensing of Coastal Plumes and Ocean Fronts: Overview and Case Study	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Coastal plumes, which carry run-off from land, influence the circulation patterns and ecology of nearby coastal areas, causing eutrophication, turbidity, and spread of harmful pollutants. They can be observed along many coasts. Estuarine and ocean fronts result when denser water under-rides lighter water giving rise to an inclined interface and a strong convergence at the surface, which can concentrate phytoplankton and pollutants. To detect and map fronts and plumes, remote sensors exploit their differences in turbidity, color, temperature, or salinity from ambient background water. The most effective remote sensing techniques for observing coastal plumes and estuarine/ocean fronts are reviewed. Studies are presented, which use data from multispectral and hyperspectral imagers, thermal infrared (TIR) radiometers, microwave radiometers, and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). Mounted on satellites and aircraft, these sensors provide the spatial/temporal resolution and coverage needed for tracking plumes and fronts, including their high temporal and spatial variability. This article reviews the most effective remote sensing techniques for observing coastal plumes and ocean fronts and illustrates the application of these techniques in a case study.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				JAN	2012	28	1A		S			1	7		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-11-00025.1								WOS:000299147900001

Bio-optical properties of east coast Malaysia waters in relation to remote sensing of chlorophyll	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Surface water samples collected during the monsoon and inter-monsoon seasons of 2009 off the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia have been analysed for concentrations of total chlorophyll, suspended particulates and coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM). Spectral absorption coefficients of dissolved and particulate materials have also been measured. Significant seasonal variabilities in concentrations and optical properties were reported with high concentrations of all parameters during the northeast monsoon (NEM) season and low during the southwest monsoon (SWM) and inter-monsoon seasons. Contrary to previous reports on the oligotrophic nature of the waters during the inter-monsoon season, relatively high concentrations of chlorophyll (>3 mg m(-3)) were observed at offshore stations in the study area in the spring and fall inter-monsoon months. The chlorophyll-specific absorption spectrum changes with the seasons with the greatest absorption per unit chlorophyll during the SWM and the least during the inter-monsoon seasons, probably in response to seasonal changes in phytoplankton community and cell size structure. The water is classified as optical case 2. At the blue end of the spectrum (440 nm), light absorption by non-phytoplankton materials (CDOM and detritus) accounts for nearly 70% of the total non-water absorption regardless of the season. At the wavelength (676 nm) of the secondary chlorophyll absorption peak in the red part of the spectrum, light absorption by chlorophyll contributes 80-90% to total non-water absorption at most stations and this may provide the basis for remote sensing of phytoplankton chlorophyll in these waters.																	0143-1161	1366-5901					2012	33	1					150	169		10.1080/01431161.2011.584917								WOS:000298946600009

The variable seafloor backscatter strength for coarser seafloor sediments are related to the diagenesis derived from biodegraded seepages. In this regard, box counting method is used to estimate 'fractal dimension' for backscatter imagery data of 398 blocks. These blocks are further sub-grouped into six classes depending on the spread of pockmark related seepages. The study area lies 102 km west off Marmagao along the central west coast of India which contains pre-dominantly (70%) gas-charged sediments. Comparison between the estimated self-similar fractals reveals that there is approximately 97% correlation between the box (D(box)) and information (D(info)) dimensions. Box dimension derived fractal dimension values, suggest that the seepages are more along the fault trace in deeper waters, in comparison to sparsely distributed shallow water seepages. Besides, this poor seepage is confined within the smooth to moderately rough seafloor. It is established that the high backscatter strength along the upper slope of the pockmark region having higher fractal dimensions reflects multifractal behavior of seepage distribution. Entire area indicates patchy seepage patterns as supported by estimated fractal values showing intermittent fluctuations, which emphasizes non-linear behavior. Estimated self organizing criticality (SOC) parameters for six representative blocks reveal that the nature of pockmark, fault trace, sediment nature coupled with slumping of pockmark's wall, sediment movement due to bottom currents are controlling the dynamic balance in the area seepage system. Further, our study emphasizing the multifractal behavior of seepage blocks, clearly depicts the drift in the seepage pattern. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Mapping of seawater inundation along Nagapattinam based on field observations	NATURAL HAZARDS												Nagapattinam, in the east coast of India, was severely affected during the deadliest Indian Ocean tsunami of December 26, 2004. The tsunami caused heavy damage to life and property, and the death toll was about 3,378 in Nagapattinam taluk. Certain villages along the coast witnessed large inundation while adjacent villages were protected from the fury of the tsunami waves. This study was carried out to examine the underlying causes for the vulnerability along Nagapattinam coast with the help of field observations, remote sensing, and geographical information system as tools. Coastal areas with high sand dunes have been protected from tsunami, and areas adjacent to backwaters were inundated. Realtime Kinematic Global Positioning System and high-resolution satellite data were used to map the topographic information and maximum extent of inundation. Thematic maps on land use, land cover, and coastal geomorphology were generated using remote sensing and field data.

Coastline serves as the basic point of reference and is used on nautical charts for navigation purposes. Its delineation has become crucial and more important in the wake of the many recent earthquakes and tsunamis resulting in complete change and redraw of some shorelines. In a tropical country like Malaysia, presence of cloud cover hinders the application of optical remote sensing data. In this study a semi-automated technique and procedures are presented for shoreline delineation from RADARSAT-1 image. A scene of RADARSAT-1 satellite image was processed using enhanced filtering technique to identify and extract the shoreline coast of Kuala Terengganu, Malaysia. RADSARSAT image has many advantages over the optical data because of its ability to penetrate cloud cover and its night sensing capabilities. At first, speckles were removed from the image by using Lee sigma filter which was used to reduce random noise and to enhance the image and discriminate the boundary between land and water. The results showed an accurate and improved extraction and delineation of the entire coastline of Kuala Terrenganu. The study demonstrated the reliability of the image averaging filter in reducing random noise over the sea surface especially near the shoreline. It enhanced land-water boundary differentiation, enabling better delineation of the shoreline. Overall, the developed techniques showed the potential of radar imagery for accurate shoreline mapping and will be useful for monitoring shoreline changes during high and low tides as well as shoreline erosion in a tropical country like Malaysia.

Remote sensing of phytoplankton community composition along the northeast coast of the United States	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Satellite imagery has proven to be a powerful tool for measuring chlorophyll a in surface waters. While this provides an estimate of total phytoplankton biomass, it does not distinguish between phytoplankton groups, many of which have functional differences and therefore affect biogeochemical cycles differently. Phytoplankton pigment analysis has been used to quantify a wide range of photosynthetic and accessory pigments, and chemotaxonomic analysis (e.g. CHEMTAX) has been used to successfully quantify functional taxonomic groups in nature based on pigment distributions. Here, we combine CHEMTAX analysis with satellite-derived distributions of specific phytoplankton pigments to describe the distributions of particular components of the phytoplankton community in the northeast coast of the United States from space. The spatial and seasonal variations in phytoplankton community structure elucidated through satellite remote sensing methods generally agreed with observations of abundance estimates of cell counts. Diatoms were generally the most abundant phytoplankton in this region, especially during Winter-Spring and in the inner shelf, but phytoplankton populations shifted to increasing abundance of other taxa during Summer, especially offshore. While still preliminary, satellite-derived taxa-specific information with proper regional controls holds promise for providing information on phytoplankton abundance to a taxonomic group level which would greatly improve our understanding of the impacts of human activity and climate change on ecosystems.

Although remote sensing and aerial photographs can supply valuable information on land/use cover changes, they may not regularly be available for some tropical coasts (e.g., Cameroon estuary) where cloud cover is frequent. With respect to mangroves, researchers are now employing local knowledge as an alternative means of understanding forest disturbances. This paper was primarily aimed at assessing the mangrove forest products usage, along with the local people's perceptions on environmental changes, between Littoral (Cameroon estuary) and Southern (mouth of the Nyong River and Mpalla village) regions of Cameroon. Methods: The data from both locations were obtained through conducting household interviews and field observations. Results: In the Cameroon estuary (Littoral region), 69.23% of respondents (mostly elders) could distinguish two to four mangrove plants, whereas the informants (65.45%) in the mouth of the Nyong River and Mpalla village (mostly young people interviewed from the Southern region) are familiar with only one or two commonly found mangroves. Also, more respondents from the Cameroon estuary are depending on mangroves for fuelwood (Rhizophora spp.) and housing (Rhizophora spp., Avicennia germinans (L.) Stearn and Nypa fruticans (Thumb.) Wurmb.) purposes, in contrast to Nyong River mouth and Mpalla village. Although local people perceived wood extraction as a greater disruptive factor, there are several causes for mangrove depletion in the Cameroon estuary. Among others, over-harvesting, clear-felled corridors, sand extraction and housing were found important. Furthermore, a decline in mangrove fauna composition (in terms of fishery products) was recorded in the Littoral as well as Southern regions. However, the causes of such perceived negative changes were not similar in both cases. Conclusions: Findings of this study highlight the need to improve sustainable management of the mangrove ecosystems through afforestation (in large impacted areas), selective removal of senescent tree stems and branches (in little damage stands), regulating sand extraction and housing activities, and creating awareness and law enforcement.																	1746-4269					DEC 6	2011	7								41	10.1186/1746-4269-7-41								WOS:000299276300001	22146073

Development of Nitrate Algorithm for the Southwest Bay of Bengal Water and Its Implication Using Remote Sensing Satellite Datasets	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING												The in situ sampled and analyzed nitrate, chlorophyll and sea surface temperature (SST) during the period 2009-2010 from monthly coastal stations and cruise datasets have been interpreted for the southwest Bay of Bengal water to develop nitrate algorithm for remote sensing applications in ocean biogeochemical cycling. The monthly sampled data points were retrieved from the coastal water around Pondicherry, Cuddalore, Parangipettai and Nagapattinam along Tamil Nadu coast, India. The cruise data has been retrieved between the coastal and offshore water along the Chennai and Kakinada (AP) segment. The SST and chlorophyll datasets has been regressed with the nitrate three dimensionally with 105 in situ data points. Parabolic function has been fitted, producing significant relationship. During the following seasons: summer (April-June), pre-monsoon (July-September), monsoon (October-December) and post-monsoon (January-March) the coefficient of determination R(2) value found to be 0.16, 0.34, 0.48 and 0.56 respectively. The satellite derived nitrate map has been generated for February 28, 2010 using Oceansat-2 OCM derived chlorophyll concentration and MODIS-Aqua derived SST basing on in situ modeled nitrate algorithm. The satellite derived nitrate concentration range has been observed to be 0.01 to 12.0 mu/L with high nitrate fronts off Tamil Nadu and Kerala coast around southern Indian tip. High nitrate and low chlorophyll (HNLC) condition has been of concern, where SST was high. Similar contrasting features in SST and nitrate images have been observed. The developed algorithm has been validated for a different dataset of March 16 and 18, 2010 and R(2) value found to be 0.508 and the algorithm observed to be working satisfactory over the southwest Bay of Bengal region.																	1939-1404					DEC	2011	4	4					983	991		10.1109/JSTARS.2011.2165204								WOS:000298054500030

Gopalakrishna			Direct and Indirect Validation of Potential Fishing Zone Advisory off the Coast of Uttara Kannada, Karnataka	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												The technique of predicting Potential Fishing Zone using satellite derived sea surface temperature and chlorophyll is becoming an important aspect for the fishermen. In the present study an attempt has been made to compare fish density/catch per unit effort in the areas predicted by Satellite imagery and available to fishermen via electronic display boards at the fish landing centers of Uttara Kannada district, Karnataka with those of non predicted areas. Direct and Indirect validation was done. Direct method means comparing the catch using fishing vessels simultaneously in the notified region with that of catch from non notified region. And in indirect method by comparing catch data from landing centers on notified days with that of non notified days. Direct validation off Karwar showed that catch was significantly higher in notified (PFZ) area with high densities as compared to non notified (non PFZ) regions. When comparisons of landing center data of Karwar, Tadadi and Bhatkal are done it is evident that in all the centers during the period under study, higher catches were observed on notified days than non notified days except in Bhatkal centre in 2009-10. There by validating the accuracy of PFZ predictions and economic gains to fishermen.																	0255-660X					DEC	2011	39	4					547	554		10.1007/s12524-011-0104-4								WOS:000297857300012						
J	Pleskachevsky, A; Lehner, S; Heege, T; Mott, C				Pleskachevsky, Andrey; Lehner, Susanne; Heege, Thomas; Mott, Claudius			Synergy and fusion of optical and synthetic aperture radar satellite data for underwater topography estimation in coastal areas	OCEAN DYNAMICS												A method to obtain underwater topography for coastal areas using state-of-the-art remote sensing data and techniques worldwide is presented. The data from the new Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite TerraSAR-X with high resolution up to 1 m are used to render the ocean waves. As bathymetry is reflected by long swell wave refraction governed by underwater structures in shallow areas, it can be derived using the dispersion relation from observed swell properties. To complete the bathymetric maps, optical satellite data of the QuickBird satellite are fused to map extreme shallow waters, e.g., in near-coast areas. The algorithms for bathymetry estimation from optical and SAR data are combined and integrated in order to cover different depth domains. Both techniques make use of different physical phenomena and mathematical treatment. The optical methods based on sunlight reflection analysis provide depths in shallow water up to 20 m in preferably calm weather conditions. The depth estimation from SAR is based on the observation of long waves and covers the areas between about 70- and 10-m water depths depending on sea state and acquisition quality. The depths in the range of 20 m up to 10 m represent the domain where the synergy of data from both sources arises. Thus, the results derived from SAR and optical sensors complement each other. In this study, a bathymetry map near Rottnest Island, Australia, is derived. QuickBird satellite optical data and radar data from TerraSAR-X have been used. The depths estimated are aligned on two different grids. The first one is a uniform rectangular mesh with a horizontal resolution of 150 m, which corresponds to an average swell wavelength observed in the 10 x 10-km SAR image acquired. The second mesh has a resolution of 150 m for depths up to 20 m (deeper domain covered by SAR-based technique) and 2.4 m resolution for the shallow domain imaged by an optical sensor. This new technique provides a platform for mapping of coastal bathymetry over a broad area on a scale that is relevant to marine planners, managers, and offshore industry.																	1616-7341					DEC	2011	61	12					2099	2120		10.1007/s10236-011-0460-1								WOS:000297622600007

Assessment of Post-Storm Recovery of Beaches Using Video Imaging Techniques: A Case Study at Gold Coast, Australia	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING					30th IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS) on Remote Sensing - Global Vision for Local Action	JUN 25-30, 2010	Honolulu, HI	IEEE				Ever-expanding networks of surf cameras offer a unique opportunity to monitor the coastline over large expanses at very little cost compared to traditional in situ survey methods. Here, we describe and test a new coastal monitoring system maintained by CoastalCOMS Pty Ltd. at their test site at Gold Coast, Australia. The two-camera system monitors two highly sensitive 4-km stretches of sandy coastline adjacent to high-value assets. The traditional static multi-camera setup has been replaced by a single rotational camera. A 14-month data set, encompassing one major storm, a recovery period, and a seasonal cycle, was analyzed. Positive shoreline detections using the new camera system were available 64% of the time (roughly 145 days of the available 226, where daily offshore significant wave heights H-8 <= 1 m). Comparison of the CoastalCOMS-derived shorelines and in situ survey data showed a mean shoreward bias of 25.5 m. Daily shoreline estimates were used to calculate weekly and five-week running mean beach widths at both sites. Analysis showed that both sites eroded between 15-22 m during the May 2009 storm and then recovered during the proceeding five-month calm period. Distinct intersite variability was observed between the more exposed Northern Beaches that displayed an annual shoreline cycle and very little intrasite variability and the more sheltered southern Palm Beach site that displayed large intrasite spatial variability and sensitivity to changes to both wave direction and wave height.

J	Sletten, MA; Hwang, PA				Sletten, Mark A.; Hwang, Paul A.			The Effect of Wind-Wave Growth on SAR-Based Waterline Maps	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING												In this paper, we investigate an issue related to the use of synthetic aperture radar imagery to detect ocean and lake waterlines. In a previous publication, the waterlines indicated by L- and P-band AIRSAR imagery of a tidal flat in South Korea were compared and found to be offset from one another by approximately 80 to 170 m. The authors postulated that the difference was due to depth-dependent dissipation or dispersion of surface waves and the subsequent modulation of the radar backscatter as described by the Bragg model. In this paper, we present an alternative explanation based on the growth of wind waves as a function of distance (i.e., fetch). This new explanation is more consistent with the environmental conditions, radar look geometry, and surface wave theory, while also explaining several finer-scale features observed in the imagery that are not addressed in the original publication. Our results indicate that the detected waterline position should be a sensitive function of radar frequency only under a restricted set of conditions, namely, when the body of water in question is cutoff from incoming swell and the only surface waves present are locally generated by a land breeze. While such conditions may occur relatively infrequently in the coastal ocean, they appear to be common when imaging the windward shores of inland lakes, as illustrated by additional AIRSAR imagery. The analysis also serves as a remote-sensing-based validation of the existing theory for wind-wave growth in a wavenumber regime not previously studied in the field.																	0196-2892					DEC	2011	49	12	2				5140	5149		10.1109/TGRS.2011.2154362								WOS:000297282300016

The case study analyzed is a Canadian boreal forest fire event on July 4, 2006 with carbonaceous aerosol smoke emission magnitudes comparable to those during the summer fire seasons of the previous decade. We track long-range transport of these aerosol plumes with data from space-borne remote sensing satellite instruments (MODIS, OMI, MISR, CALIOP lidar, AIRS) and ground-based in situ and remote aerosol observations (AERONET CIMEL sky/Sun photometer, MPLNET lidar, IMPROVE, EPA AirNow). Convective lofting elevated smoke emissions above the boundary layer into the free troposphere, where high speed winds aloft led to rapid, long-range transport. Aerosol layer subsidence occurred during transport due to a region of surface high pressure. Smoke aerosols reaching the boundary layer led to surface fine particulate matter (PM2.5) enhancements accompanied by changes in aerosol composition as the plume mixed with anthropogenic aerosols over the northeastern U.S. The extensive coverage of this smoke plume over the northeastern U.S. affected regional air quality, with increases of 10-20 mu g m(-3) PM2.5 attributable to biomass burning smoke aerosols and EPA 24-hour PM2.5 standard exceedances along the U.S. East Coast. Although each data set individually provides a limited view of the transport of smoke emissions, we demonstrate that a multi-data set approach results in a more comprehensive view of potential impacts due to long-range transport of smoke from a less extreme fire event. Our case study demonstrates that fires emit smoke aerosols that under certain meteorological conditions can degrade regional air quality 3000 km from the source region, with additional implications for aerosol radiative forcing and regional haze over the northeastern U.S.				Dubovik, Oleg/A-8235-2009; Xiongfei, Zhao/G-7690-2015; Welton, Ellsworth/A-8362-2012; Ginoux, Paul/C-2326-2008; Zondlo, Mark/R-6173-2016	Dubovik, Oleg/0000-0003-3482-6460; Ginoux, Paul/0000-0003-3642-2988; Zondlo, Mark/0000-0003-2302-9554												2169-897X	2169-8996				NOV 22	2011	116								D22209	10.1029/2011JD016170								WOS:000297421100003

Environmental controls on the spatial variability of savanna productivity in the Northern Territory, Australia	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) is a critical measure of the health and sustainability of natural ecosystems. Understanding the magnitude, spatial patterns and processes of GPP will underpin predictions of the impact of climate change on the carbon cycle. In Australia, savannas account for one third of the terrestrial carbon stores and therefore, estimating the magnitude of savanna GPP and studying the spatial relationship between GPP and environmental determinants at the regional scale is essential in understanding ecosystem responses to increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations and climate change. In this study we employed an integrated approach combining in situ measurements, eddy covariance based flux tower data and remote sensing techniques to examine the role of environmental drivers in controlling the spatial variation in GPP of savannas in the Northern Territory (NT), Australia. We used field based light use efficiency (LUE), regional specific meteorology and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) based fraction of absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (fPAR) data to estimate GPP. The estimated GPP agreed quite well (only a 6% error) with GPP estimated from flux tower at the Howard Springs site. The spatial pattern of GPP along the Northern Australian Tropical Transect (NATT) was calculated and showed a strong gradient in GPP from the coast (12.50 degrees S where rainfall was 1622 mm year(-1)) to inland (17.73 degrees S where mean rainfall was 643 mm year(-1)) with a decrease of 77%. A decreasing trend in GPP with rainfall is noticed especially at the dry end of the transect studied. However, in the wet end and middle part of the transect (e.g. dominated by different Eucalyptus species), the response of GPP to changes in rainfall is reduced. This finding suggests that the influence of rainfall on various Eucalyptus species may be dampened by biotic factors. Our results suggest that future changes in precipitation driven by climate change may affect the future distribution and dynamics of GPP in northern Australia. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Multicriterial analysis in the investigation of favorable areas for edifications with shallow and deep foundations in the Municipality of Campos dos Goytacazes - Rio de Janeiro, Brazil	ENGINEERING GEOLOGY												The Municipality of Campos dos Goytacazes is located on the northern coast of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The city developed on a floodplain and as a consequence of this occupation it has experienced problems with the water table level, drainage system, soil carrying capacity and aquifers contamination. The purpose of this paper was to accomplish a geological and environmental study, producing interpretive and derived geotechnical maps to analyze the degree of aptitudes or restrictions of the physical environment for urban expansion. In order to do this, the methodology of multicriterial analysis was used, combined with pedological indicators resulting in the elaboration of the Favorability Maps for Buildings (Shallow and Deep Foundations). The remote sensing tools. GIS and GPS, sped up the elaboration of the Information Plans. The maps generated in this work allow us to indicate problems in the physical environment serving as a guide to urbanization. It was verified that the city expands into unsuitable areas and it is recommended as areas for expansion those considered favorable in the outcomes of this research. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Discrimination of coastal wetland environments in the Amazon region based on multi-polarized L-band airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												This study assessed the use of multi-polarized L-band images for the identification of coastal wetland environments in the Amazon coast region of northern Brazil. Data were acquired with a SAR R99B sensor from the Amazon Surveillance System (SIVAM) on board a Brazilian Air Force jet. Flights took place in the framework of the 2005 MAPSAR simulation campaign, a German-Brazilian feasibility study focusing on a L-band SAR satellite. Information retrieval was based on the recognition of the interaction between a radar signal and shallow-water morphology in intertidal areas, coastal dunes, mangroves, marshes and the coastal plateau. Regarding the performance of polarizations, VV was superior for recognizing intertidal area morphology under low spring tide conditions; HH for mapping coastal environments covered with forest and scrub vegetation such as mangrove and vegetated dunes, and HV was suitable for distinguishing transition zones between mangroves and coastal plateau. The statistical results for the classification maps expressed by kappa index and general accuracy were 83.3% and 0.734 for the multi-polarized color composition (R-HH, G-HV, B-VV), 80.7% and 0.694% for HH, 79.7% and 0.673% for W, and 77.9% and 0.645% for HV amplitude image. The results indicate that use of multi-polarized L-band SAR is a valuable source of information aiming at the identification and discrimination of distinct geomorphic targets in tropical wetlands.

Turbidity characterizes the reproduction areas of pikeperch (Sander lucioperca (L.)) in the northern Baltic Sea	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												The pikeperch (Sander lucioperca (L.)) is an economically important fish species occurring in the fresh and brackish waters of Europe. To evaluate the distribution and extent of the reproduction areas in the northern Baltic Sea, a field survey was carried out in two separate coastal areas. Presence/absence data were used to develop a geographic information system (GIS)-based predictive spatial distribution model, where high resolution raster maps of the focal environmental variables and a logistic regression equation were used to predict the probability of larval occurrence. The results indicated that the pikeperch reproduction areas are located in the innermost archipelago zone where high water turbidity best explained their presence. Turbidity was related to several other variables such as fetch and depth. Contrary to our preliminary hypothesis, surface water temperatures measured during the survey had no significant effect in the model due to the low spatial variation in the measured values. Since turbidity is possible to determine by remote sensing methods, the probability maps can be cost-effectively extended to more extensive coastal areas with proper validation.

GIS modelling of intertidal wetland exposure characteristics. Journal of Coastal Research, 27(6A), 44-51. West Palm Beach (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. Exposure to solar radiation and tidal inundation are important factors for a wide variety of chemical and ecological processes in coastal ecosystems. Accurate quantification of these factors is often difficult on a local scale. To address this research gap, a remote-sensing approach was developed to model inundation and radiation characteristics within an intertidal zone located in the Minas Basin (Bay of Fundy, Nova Scotia, Canada). A light detection and ranging (LIDAR) derived elevation model was subjected to tidal modelling based on hourly sea level predictions and solar modelling based on sunrise and sunset times for 2009. Model results indicated an intertidal zone of 145.8 km(2) with an elevation between 6.9 m and 6.8 m. The intertidal zone was determined to contain three unique wetland classes: (1) 4.4 km(2) of high salt marsh, dominated by Spartina patens; (2) 5.0 km(2) of low salt marsh, dominated by Spartina alterniflora; and (3) 63.1 km(2) of nonvegetated marine flat (73.3 km(2) unclassified intertidal). Detailed exposure characteristics were calculated for each of the classes within the intertidal zone at 10-cm vertical intervals. Exposure calculations for 2009 showed that an average of 4.2 km(2) of salt marsh were exposed to solar radiation and 8.4 km(2) were exposed to the atmosphere each hour. Similarly, 11.7 km(2) of marine flat were exposed to solar radiation and 22.9 km(2) were exposed to the atmosphere each hour. The developed remote-sensing techniques successfully established intertidal zones, uniquely identified wetland classes, and modelled inundation and solar exposure characteristics within the study area.

Such information is unavailable for Louisiana at sufficient spatial and thematic detail. We prepared mangrove forest distribution maps of Louisiana (prior to the oil spill) at 1 m and 30 m spatial resolution using aerial photographs and Landsat satellite data, respectively. Image classification was performed using a decision-tree classification approach. We also prepared land-cover change pairs for 1983, 1984, and every 2 y from 1984 to 2010 depicting "ecosystem shifts" (e.g., expansion, retraction, and disappearance). This new spatiotemporal information could be used to assess short-term and long-term impacts of the oil spill on mangroves. Finally, we propose an operational methodology based on remote sensing (Landsat, Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer [ASTER], hyperspectral, light detection and ranging [LIDAR], aerial photographs, and field inventory data) to monitor the existing and emerging mangrove areas and their disturbance and regrowth patterns. Several parameters such as spatial distribution, ecosystem shifts, species composition, and tree height/biomass could be measured to assess the impact of the oil spill and mangrove recovery and restoration. Future research priorities will be to quantify the impacts and recovery of mangroves considering multiple stressors and perturbations, including oil spill, winter freeze, sea-level rise, land subsidence, and land-use/land-cover change for the entire Gulf Coast.																	0749-0208					NOV	2011	27	6					1059	1064		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-11-00028.1								WOS:000297278300005

Narendra			Assessment of aquaculture impact on mangroves of Mahanadi delta (Orissa), East coast of India using remote sensing and GIS	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												Aquaculture is one of the fastest growing food industries. However, the rapid growth of aquaculture worldwide has resulted in growing concerns about its impact on important ecosystems. The expansion of aquaculture farms in the coastal areas has led to conversion of mangroves, more rapidly. To assess the impact of aquaculture on mangroves, the present study has been undertaken in Mahanadi delta of Orissa, East coast of India which is famous for its distinctive mangrove ecosystem. It has undergone tremendous changes due to the development of aquaculture and agriculture activities during last two decades. For this, satellite data of different time periods (Landsat MSS of 1973, Landsat TM of 1990 and IRS P6 LISS III of 2006) were used. It was found that the delta was occupied by dense mangrove (12.6%), open mangrove (3.3%), aquaculture (12.9%) and agriculture (30.9%) in 2006. A loss of 2606 ha mangrove area and an increase of 3657 ha aquaculture area was observed from 1973 to 2006 clearly depicts the augment of aquaculture industry. It is suggested that, regular monitoring of the mangroves and effective implementation of coastal management laws be strictly undertaken to prevent the further loss mangroves in Mahanadi delta.

We investigate this topic by examining changes in forest cover on the Atlantic Coast of Nicaragua from 1978 to 1993, a period covering their civil war. We predict an increase in forest cover between pre- and post-conflict periods as residents abandoned agriculture plots and migrated from conflict areas. We used a remote sensing approach to detect changes in forest cover area and fragmentation at two study sites. Results confirmed that in the first 5-7 years of the conflict, reforestation was greater than deforestation, but in the latter years of the conflict deforested land almost doubled that which was reforested. Although some forest loss was due to Category 4 Hurricane Joan, several conflict-related factors were partially responsible for these results, such as mass human migration and land reform. Understanding how and why forest cover changes during periods of conflict can help conservationists protect resources both during war and in the tumultuous period following the cessation of violence when nascent governments lack the power to effectively govern and community institutions are fractured by war. In areas where the livelihoods of people are directly dependent on local resources, anticipating ecological and social impacts can help improve future conservation efforts.																	0960-3115					NOV	2011	20	12					2597	2613		10.1007/s10531-011-0093-1								WOS:000297200000004

Qocha are a little known form of Andean agriculture that developed around 800-500 B.C. and remain in use today. Prior estimates suggested that in the study area, there were more than 25,000 qocha. While most Andean sunken beds are excavated to reach groundwater, qocha are rainfed ponds. How these rain-fed ponds functioned has been an open question, but one that is answered in part by research presented in this paper. We suggest that a thick impermeable stratum of clay that was possibly deposited by paleolake "Minchin" created a perched water table that makes rain-fed qocha reservoir agriculture possible. Field geology shows that within the study area, this stratum only exists under Terrace E. Based on this model, we hypothesized that persistently used qocha should only be found on Terrace E. To test this hypothesis we used remotely sensed data to inventory qocha and to determine their distribution by each terrace present. We identified 11,737 qocha.

On the glacier area itself, quantifying information coming from remote and in situ sensing is easily performed thanks to the smooth and flat surface. Such quantitative processing is however more complex on the slopes, where effective areas converted to 2D projections hide a great part of the information : the steeper the slope, the larger the correction between projected area and effective area. In the present study, the mean slope angle is 35, while slopes account for a third of the whole area of the basin. In the frame of the Hydro-Sensor-FlOWS program (2006-2010), a network of sensors has been installed around the AustreLoven glacier (5 km(2)), on the West coast of Svalbard (79 degrees N). Some automated digital cameras are located at strategic places of the glacier basin to cover the whole glacier. While ground based tangential picture geometrical correction is efficient on the flattest parts of the glacier, it becomes ineffective on the steep slopes. The present article demonstrates how quantitative information can be recovered even without geometric correction of the pictures. Using the required datasets (digital elevation models, camera coordinates and satellite imagery), in situ pictures provide the snow coverage on the slopes. This work demonstrates the complementary use of zenithal and tangential views in order to better understand slope dynamics.																	0018-6368					OCT	2011		5					20	28		10.1051/lhb/2011048								WOS:000298068400004

Bragg-resonant backscattering by ocean waves with half the electromagnetic radar wavelength allows ocean surface currents to be measured at distances up to 200 km. When a tsunami propagates from the deep ocean to shallow water, a specific ocean current signature is generated throughout the water column. Due to the long range of an HF radar, it is possible to detect this current signature at the shelf edge. When the shelf edge is about 100 km in front of the coastline, the radar can detect the tsunami about 45 min before it hits the coast, leaving enough time to issue an early warning. As up to now no HF radar measurements of an approaching tsunami exist, a simulation study has been done to fix parameters like the required spatial resolution or the maximum coherent integration time allowed. The simulation involves several steps, starting with the Hamburg Shelf Ocean Model (HAMSOM) which is used to estimate the tsunami-induced current velocity at 1 km spatial resolution and 1 s time step. This ocean current signal is then superimposed to modelled and measured HF radar backscatter signals using a new modulation technique. After applying conventional HF radar signal processing techniques, the surface current maps contain the rapidly changing tsunami-induced current features, which can be compared to the HAMSOM data. The specific radial tsunami current signatures can clearly be observed in these maps, if appropriate spatial and temporal resolution is used. Based on the entropy of the ocean current maps, a tsunami detection algorithm is described which can be used to issue an automated tsunami warning message.																	1616-7341					OCT	2011	61	10					1495	1507		10.1007/s10236-011-0420-9								WOS:000295681200005

The system consists of two video cameras connected to a PC, and is operating at the meso-tidal, reflective Faro Beach (Algarve coast, S. Portugal). Measurements from the period February 4, 2009 to May 30, 2010 are discussed in this study. Shoreline detection was based on the processing of variance images, considering pixel intensity thresholds for feature extraction, provided by a specially trained artificial neural network (ANN). The obtained shoreline data return rate was 83%, with an average horizontal cross-shore root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.06 m. Several empirical parameterizations and ANN models were tested to estimate the elevations of shoreline contours, using wave and tidal data. Using a manually validated shoreline set, the lowest RMSE (0.18 m) for the vertical elevation was obtained using an ANN while empirical parameterizations based on the tidal elevation and wave run-up height resulted in an RMSE of 0.26 m. These errors were reduced to 0.22 m after applying 3-D data filtering and interpolation of the topographic information generated for each tidal cycle. Average beach-face slope tan(beta) RMSE were around 0.02. Tests for a 5-month period of fully automated operation applying the ANN model resulted in an optimal, average, vertical elevation RMSE of 0.22 m, obtained using a one tidal cycle time window and a time-varying beach-face slope. The findings indicate that the use of an ANN in such systems has considerable potential, especially for sites where long-term field data allow efficient training.

Molecular ecology meets remote sensing: environmental drivers to population structure of humpback dolphins in the Western Indian Ocean	HEREDITY												Genetic analyses of population structure can be placed in explicit environmental contexts if appropriate environmental data are available. Here, we use high-coverage and high-resolution oceanographic and genetic sequence data to assess population structure patterns and their potential environmental influences for humpback dolphins in the Western Indian Ocean. We analyzed mitochondrial DNA data from 94 dolphins from the coasts of South Africa, Mozambique, Tanzania and Oman, employing frequency-based and maximum-likelihood algorithms to assess population structure and migration patterns. The genetic data were combined with 13 years of remote sensing oceanographic data of variables known to influence cetacean dispersal and population structure. Our analyses show strong and highly significant genetic structure between all putative populations, except for those in South Africa and Mozambique. Interestingly, the oceanographic data display marked environmental heterogeneity between all sampling areas and a degree of overlap between South Africa and Mozambique. Our combined analyses therefore suggest the occurrence of genetically isolated populations of humpback dolphins in areas that are environmentally distinct. This study highlights the utility of molecular tools in combination with high-resolution and high-coverage environmental data to address questions not only pertaining to genetic population structure, but also to relevant ecological processes in marine species.

J	Wong, MS; Nichol, J; Ng, E				Wong, Man Sing; Nichol, Janet; Ng, Edward			A study of the "wall effect" caused by proliferation of high-rise buildings using GIS techniques	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING												This paper describes a novel method using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to investigate the "wall effect" caused by proliferation of high-rise buildings along the coast in Kowloon Peninsula of Hong Kong. The research utilises the concept of building frontal area index which is calculated based on three dimensional buildings in 100 m grid cells. The main ventilation pathways across the urban area are located using Least Cost Path analysis in a raster GIS and validated by field measurements. Field measurements were also taken in front of windward and leeward buildings. Results show that winds are forced by high frontal area values, to deviate around coastlines with blocks of "wall effect" buildings parallel to the coast. Average wind speeds of 10.5 m s(-1) were observed on the windward side of "wall effect" buildings defined according to a southeasterly wind direction, while average wind speeds immediately to the lee side of "wall effect" buildings as well as further inland, were approximately 2.5 m s(-1) (four times lower). To confirm the "wall effect" hypothesis, scenario analysis was performed by removing these buildings from the model and re-running it. This revealed a 5% increase of air ventilation to urban areas inland, since more fresh onshore air is able to penetrate from the coast. This improvement is significant since only 0.05% of buildings in the study area were removed. Overlay of the ventilation pathways over a thermal satellite image representing Heat Island Intensity (HII) indicated significantly lower HII values, and reduced extent of the core HI I areas, around the ventilation paths.

Samples were collected along three cruise transects from Jaeren, Lista and Oksoy on the south coast of Norway and into the North Sea and Skagerrak. We also followed a drifting buoy for 55 h in Skagerrak in order to observe diel variations. Satellite ocean color images (SeaWiFS) of the chlorophyll a (chl a) distribution compared favorably to in situ measurements in open waters, while closer to the shore remote sensing chl a data was overestimated compared to the in situ data. Using light microscopy, we identified 49 micro- and 15 nanoplankton sized phototrophic forms as well as 40 micro- and 12 nanoplankton sized heterotrophic forms. The only picoeukaryote (0.2-2.0 mu m) we identified was Resultor micron (Pedinophyceae). Along the transects a significant variation in the distribution and abundance of different plankton forms were observed, with Synechococcus spp and autotrophic picoeukaryotes as the most notable examples. There was no correlation between viruses and chl a, but between viruses and bacteria, and between viruses and some of the phytoplankton groups, especially the picoeukaryotes. Moreover, there was a negative correlation between nutrients and small viruses (Low Fluorescent Viruses) but a positive correlation between nutrients and large viruses (High Fluorescent Viruses). The abundance of autotrophic picoplankton, bacteria and viruses showed a diel variation in surface waters with higher values around noon and late at night and lower values in the evening. Synechococcus spp were found at 20 m depth 25-45 nautical miles from shore apparently forming a bloom that stretched out for more than 100 nautical miles from Skagerrak and up the south west coast of Norway. The different methods used for assessing abundance, distribution and diversity of microorganisms yielded complementary information about the plankton community. Flow cytometry enabled us to map the distribution of the smaller phytoplankton forms, bacteria and viruses in more detail than has been possible before but detection and quantification of specific forms (genus or species) still requires taxonomic skills, molecular analysis or both.

Firstly, the algorithms were run using similar to 80 in situ Remote Sensing Reflectance, (R-rs(lambda)) data collected from coastal areas during eight cruises from January 2000 to March 2002 and the output was compared to in situ Chla. Secondly, the algorithms were run with similar to 20 SeaWiFS R-rs(lambda) and the results were compared with coincident in situ Chla. In both cases, OC5 exhibited the lowest log(10)-RMS, bias, had a slope close to 1 and this algorithm appears to be the most accurate for both coastal and open ocean areas. Thirdly the error in the algorithms was regressed against Total Suspended Material (TSM) and Coloured Dissolved Organic Material (CDOM) data to assess the co-variance with these parameters. The OC5 error did not co-vary with TSM and CDOM. OC4v6 tended to over-estimate Chla >2 mg m(-3) and the error in OC4v6 co-varied with TSM. OC4v6 was more accurate than the Carder algorithm, which over-estimated Chla at concentrations >1 mg m(-3) and under-estimated Chla at values <0.5 mg m(-3). The error in Carder Chla also co-varied with TSM. The algorithms were inter-compared using >5500 SeaWiFS R-rs(lambda) data from coastal to offshore transects in the Northern Bay of Bengal. There was good agreement between OC4v6 and OC5 in open ocean waters and in coastal areas up to 2 mg m(-3). There was a strong divergence between Carder and OC5 in open ocean and coastal waters. OC4v6 and Carder tended to over-estimate Chla in coastal areas by a factor of 2 to 3 when TSM >25 g m(-3). We strongly recommend the use of OC5 for coastal and open ocean waters of the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea. A Chla time series was generated using OC5 from 2000 to 2003, which showed that concentrations at the mouths of the Ganges reach a maxima (similar to 5 mg m(-3)) in October and November and were 0.08 mg m(-3) further offshore increasing to 0.2 mg m(-3) during December. Similarly in early spring from February to March, Chla was 0.08 to 0.2 mg m(-3) on the east coast of the Bay. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This system, known as the Microwave Integrated Retrieval System (MiRS), ensures that the final solution is consistent with the measurements and, when used as input to the forward operator, fits them to within the instrument noise levels. In the presence of precipitation, this variational algorithm retrieves a set of hydrometeor products consisting of cloud liquid water, ice water, and rain water content profiles. This paper presents the development and assessment of the MiRS rainfall rate that is derived based on a predetermined relationship of the rainfall with these hydrometeor products. Since this relationship relies on the geophysical products retrieved by the MiRS as inputs and not on sensor-dependent parameters, the technique is suitable for all microwave sensors to which the MiRS is applied. This precipitation technique has been designed to facilitate its transition from research to operations when applied to current and future satellite-based sensors. Currently, the MiRS rainfall rate technique has been implemented operationally at the U. S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for the NOAA-18, NOAA-19, Metop-A Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit, and Microwave Humidity Sensor, as well as for the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP)-F16 and DMSP-F18 Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder microwave satellite sensors. For the validation of the MiRS rainfall rate technique, extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art precipitation products derived from rain gauge, ground-based radar, and satellite-based microwave observations are presented for different regions and seasons, and over land and ocean. The MiRS rainfall rate technique is shown to estimate precipitation, with a skill comparable to other satellite-based microwave precipitation algorithms, including the MSPPS, 3B40RT, and MWCOMB, while showing no discontinuities at coasts. This is a relevant result, considering that the MiRS is a system not merely designed to retrieve the rainfall rate but to consistently estimate a comprehensive set of atmospheric and surface parameters from microwave measurements.				chen, ruiyue/F-6708-2010; Iturbide-Sanchez, Flavio/F-9186-2014; Boukabara, Sid Ahmed/F-5577-2010; Garrett, Kevin/L-7582-2016; Weng, Fuzhong/F-5633-2010; Grassotti, Christopher/N-5887-2017	Iturbide-Sanchez, Flavio/0000-0002-8539-0073; Boukabara, Sid Ahmed/0000-0002-1857-3806; Garrett, Kevin/0000-0002-7444-4363; Weng, Fuzhong/0000-0003-0150-2179; Grassotti, Christopher/0000-0001-8784-473X												0196-2892					SEP	2011	49	9			SI		3311	3333		10.1109/TGRS.2011.2119375								WOS:000294536700016

Cross-shore gradients in sea surface temperature (SST) were observed, including cold fronts (colder inshore) during winter and warm fronts (warmer inshore) during summer. Fronts persisted over synoptic and seasonal time-scales and had a periodic annual cycle over a 10-year time-series. Measurements of cross-shore SST variability were conducted at the scale of tens of kilometres, which encompassed temperature over shallow tropical reef complexes and the continental slope. Two tropical reefs that had similar reef geomorphology and offshore continental slope topography had identical cold fronts, although they were separated by 100 km along the Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia. Satellite SST gradients across contours of topography of tropical reefs can be used as an index to flag areas potentially exposed to temperature stress.				da Silva, Jose/B-9212-2008; Scientific output, CIIMAR/E-5122-2012	da Silva, Jose/0000-0002-5453-3916; Scientific output, CIIMAR/0000-0001-6270-2153												1054-3139					SEP	2011	68	9					1827	1832		10.1093/icesjms/fsr109								WOS:000294107800001

The wetlands along this coast are important stopover sites during bird migration between wintering and breeding sites. The use of remote sensing methods for mapping bird migration habitats and for temporal monitoring of changes in these habitats was investigated. The Amvrakikos Gulf, a coastal wetland complex along the west coast of Greece, was selected as the study area. Landsat TM and ETM+images and ASTER VNIR images were used to perform a post-classification change detection over a time period of 15 years (1989-2004). In order to assess the spatial quality of existing wetland patches, spatial metrics (such as patch area, distance between the patches, and proximity) were calculated. To study changes in the degree of fragmentation of the stopover area, a binary patch structure was used in which the focal patches were embedded in a neutral matrix. The results showed that Landsat and ASTER VNIR satellite images can be used to trace small wetlands of approximately 0.5 ha minimum. These data sources are suitable for monitoring changes in wetlands, in particular marshes and mudflats, which are important habitats for migratory waterbirds. In the 15-year period that has been studied there was an estimated 32% decrease in marsh and mudflat area. Among this decrease, 25% went to water surface and 7% to vegetation in the months of August and September. Within the same period of time, a higher degree of fragmentation of the potential bird migration habitat has also been recorded. For this purpose, the remote sensing approach used in this study where change detection is performed on freely available Landsat and ASTER satellite images could be an interesting tool for policy makers and managers, as they allow easy recognition and monitoring of changes in wetlands and therefore contribute to an evaluation of the efficiency of protection and management schemes applied by countries for their wetlands.

This can be performed by extrapolating the aerosol optical properties in the visible from the near-infrared (NIR) spectral region assuming that the seawater is totally absorbant in this latter part of the spectrum. However, the non-negligible water-leaving radiance in the NIR which is characteristic of turbid waters may lead to an overestimate of the atmospheric radiance in the whole visible spectrum with increasing severity at shorter wavelengths. This may result in significant errors, if not complete failure, of various algorithms for the retrieval of chlorophyll-a concentration, inherent optical properties and biogeochemical parameters of surface waters. This paper presents results of an inter-comparison study of three methods that compensate for NIR water-leaving radiances and that are based on very different hypothesis: 1) the standard Sea WiFS algorithm (Stumpfet al., 2003; Bailey et al., 2010) based on a bio-optical model and an iterative process; 2) the algorithm developed by Ruddick et al. (2000) based on the spatial homogeneity of the NIR ratios of the aerosol and water-leaving radiances; and 3) the algorithm of Kuchinke et al. (2009) based on a fully coupled atmosphere-ocean spectral optimization inversion. They are compared using normalized water-leaving radiance nL(w) in the visible. The reference source for comparison is ground-based measurements from three AERONET-Ocean Color sites, one in the Adriatic Sea and two in the East Coast of USA. Based on the matchup exercise, the best overall estimates of the nL(w) are obtained with the latest SeaWiFS standard algorithm version with relative error varying from 14.97% to 35.27% for lambda = 490 nm and lambda = 670 nm respectively. The least accurate estimates are given by the algorithm of Ruddick, the relative errors being between 16.36% and 42.92% for lambda = 490 nm and lambda = 412 nm, respectively. The algorithm of Kuchinke appears to be the most accurate algorithm at 412 nm (30.02%), 510 (15.54%) and 670 nm (32.32%) using its default optimization and bio-optical model coefficient settings. Similar conclusions are obtained for the aerosol optical properties (aerosol optical thickness tau(865) and the Angstrom exponent, alpha(510, 865)). Those parameters are retrieved more accurately with the SeaWiFS standard algorithm (relative error of 33% and 54.15% for tau(865) and alpha(510, 865)). A detailed analysis of the hypotheses of the methods is given for explaining the differences between the algorithms. The determination of the aerosol parameters is critical for the algorithm of Ruddick et al. (2000) while the bio-optical model is critical for the algorithm of Stumpf et al. (2003) utilized in the standard SeaWiFS atmospheric correction and both aerosol and bio-optical model for the coupled atmospheric-ocean algorithm of Kuchinke. The Kuchinke algorithm presents model aerosol-size distributions that differ from real aerosol-size distribution pertaining to the measurements. In conclusion, the results show that for the given atmospheric and oceanic conditions of this study, the SeaWiFS atmospheric correction algorithm is most appropriate for estimating the marine and aerosol parameters in the given turbid waters regions.

As part of the Coastal Zone Management strategy, regular monitoring of shoreline changes plays an important role. Growing population in coastal zones creates extra pressure on shores which leads to the creation of new land filling areas (accretion). Moreover, a recently completed highway construction caused a catastrophic impact on coastal areas of the southern part of the Black Sea and needs to be taken into account. The main purpose of this article is to determine the pattern of shoreline changes along the Turkish coast of the Black Sea. Remote sensing is used to identify and evaluate hot spots of shoreline changes. A developed algorithm automatically extracts the coast line position by processing satellite images covering the period of 1987 to 2001. The maximum and minimum shoreline changes in terms of erosion and accretion were 118 to 53 and 95 to 635 m, respectively. More significant changes have been determined in the eastern part than the western part of the Black Sea. The locations with higher changes were mainly accretion regions along the study area. It can be concluded that coastal movements mainly caused by humans induced impacts at the coasts of the Black Sea.

Latitudinal variations of the yield and quality of agar from Gelidium robustum (Gelidiales, Rhodophyta) from the main commercial harvest beds along the western coast of the Baja California Peninsula, Mexico	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYCOLOGY												The yield and quality of agar from Gelidium robustum from the main commercial harvest beds along the western coast of the Baja California Peninsula (Mexico) were evaluated within a latitudinal range of about 800 km (31A degrees 47'N to 27A degrees 05'N). Samples from six locations, Bahia Todos Santos, El Rosario, Isla de Cedros, Islas San Benito, Punta Eugenia, and Bahia Asuncin, were analyzed. Bryozoan, protein, and agar content in the seaweed were estimated. The agar quality was determined by the content of 3,6-anhydrogalactose, sulfate, gel strength, and gelling and melting temperature. All the values of these variables were correlated and then with the satellite-derived data of the sea surface temperature (SST), net primary production (NPP), and photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) measured at each harvest bed during the summer months (June, July, and August) of 2000. In the northern and central region, the agar yield was 35% to 37% (Bahia Todos Santos, El Rosario, Isla de Cedros, and Islas San Benito), whereas lower yields were obtained from the southern beds (Punta Eugenia and Bahia Asuncin). In contrast, the agar quality increased from the northern to the southern beds. A lower gel strength was obtained from Bahia Todos Santos and El Rosario (268 A +/- 16 and 205 A +/- 5 gcm(-2)) with a higher gel strength obtained from Isla de Cedros, Islas San Benito, and Bahia Asuncin (384 to 444 A +/- 25 gcm(-2)). Yield was not correlated with the bryozoan content but was inversely correlated with the protein content in the seaweed. The sulfate content in the agar was inversely correlated with the gel strength and with the melting temperature. The 3,6-anhydrogalactose content showed slight variations among harvested beds. Analysis of satellite-derived data showed an equatorward increase of the SST, NPP, and PAR. The agar content correlated inversely with the equatorward increase of the NPP, whereas agar quality, i.e., gel strength, correlated positively with the NPP and PAR. No significant effects were observed on the yield and quality of agar with the latitudinal change of the SST.

Detection of seagrass in optical shallow water with Quickbird in the Xincun Bay, Hainan province, China	IET IMAGE PROCESSING												Different substrate types, such as seagrass, sand, stone and silt, can be identified by detecting substrate reflectivity. In this study, high-resolution remote sensing data of Quickbird were used to map seagrass distribution in the northeast coast of the Xincun Bay. Radiance transfer model in optical shallow water was used to retrieve bottom reflectivity; relationship between hyperspectral band and leaf area index (LAI) was used for processing satellite remote sensing data to retrieve distribution and density of submerged seagrass. Hyperspectral results showed that spectral bands at 550, 650 and 675 nm were sensitive to LAI. Based on the relationship between LAI and hyperspectral bands, Bands 2 and 3 of Quickbird could be used for retrieving seagrass distribution. Satellite results showed that seagrass was mainly distributed in clusters in the northeast coast of the Xincun Bay, tens of metres away from the bank. Density gradient was very clear, with coverage between 40 and 60% occupied by a great part of seagrass bed and with coverage greater than 80% distributed in stripe pattern in the main seagrass bed. The accuracy of seagrass retrieval was more than 80%, and the density of seagrass could also be distinguished evidently.																	1751-9659					AUG	2011	5	5					363	368		10.1049/iet-ipr.2009.0392								WOS:000292960800003

Constrained by these data, models have been used for predictions and warning of the arrival of a tsunami, but to date no detailed verification of flow patterns nor area measurements have been possible. Here we present unique HF-radar area observations of the tsunami signal seen in current velocities as the wave train approaches the coast. Networks of coastal HF-radars are now routinely observing surface currents in many countries and we report clear results from five HF radar sites spanning a distance of 8,200 km on two continents following the magnitude 9.0 earthquake off Sendai, Japan, on 11 March 2011. We confirm the tsunami signal with three different methodologies and compare the currents observed with coastal sea level fluctuations at tide gauges. The distance offshore at which the tsunami can be detected, and hence the warning time provided, depends on the bathymetry: the wider the shallow continental shelf, the greater this time. Data from these and other radars around the Pacific rim can be used to further develop radar as an important tool to aid in tsunami observation and warning as well as post-processing comparisons between observation and model predictions.																	2072-4292					AUG	2011	3	8					1663	1679		10.3390/rs3081663								WOS:000306751500008						
J	Zhang, Y				Zhang, Yang			Coastal environmental monitoring using remotely sensed data and GIS techniques in the Modern Yellow River delta, China	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												On the basis of remote sensing and GIS techniques, the Landsat data obtained in 1987, 1996, and 2008 were used to examine coastline changes in the Modern Yellow River (MYR) delta in China. The coastal land lost and gained illustrations were derived, the rates of coastal change were estimated, and the coastal parts that experienced severe changes were identified. The results revealed that the accretion rates in the MYR delta coast has been decelerating while the accretion effect remained. Taken the artificial coast from the south of ShenXianGou (SXG) to Gudong Oil Field (GOF) as the landmark, the coast in the south of the landmark showed an accretion pattern, while the coast in the west of the landmark showed an erosion pattern. Wherein, the coast from Chao River Estuary (CRE) to Zhuang 106 (Z106) showed an erosion pattern with the transition from erosion to accretion and the accelerated rates from east to west. The coast from Z106 to the south border of GOF also showed erosion pattern but significant differences existed among the internal coastal parts. The coast from the south border of GOF to XiaoDao River Estuary (XDRE) showed a pattern from rapid accretion to dynamic balance of accretion/erosion, and the trend towards erosion. The coast from XDRE to XiaoQing River Estuary (XQRE) showed slow accretion pattern. Human activities have heavily influenced the natural evolution of the MYR delta coast.																	0167-6369					AUG	2011	179	1-4					15	29		10.1007/s10661-010-1716-9								WOS:000292745000002	20862539

ERDKUNDE												We present an initial study to project the long-term development of fog occurrence along the southern African west coast. For this purpose, we implemented a basic fog diagnostic scheme based on liquid water content into the regional climate model REMO. The validation of the fog diagnostic scheme is conducted using satellite-derived low cloud information as well as local station observations. The validation reveals that REMO is able to adequately represent the major fog characteristics in the region. The observed strong fog gradient from the coast to the regions further inland is correctly simulated by the model. Also, the seasonal as well as diurnal fog distribution characteristics are captured by REMO. However, some deficits still remain in the absolute amount of simulated fog days. These deficits can mainly be attributed to the coarse vertical resolution of the model as well as to the simple fog diagnostics approach chosen. Regarding the long-term development of fog, two 20-year time slice simulations for a control (1981 to 2000) and a future (2081 to 2100) period following the A1B emission scenario were conducted. The model generally projects a slight increase in the number of fog days for the coastal areas and a slight decrease for the regions located further inland. Especially the latter has the potential to exacerbate the existing water scarcity in the region.

The analysis results show: (1) Three stages of significant SLHF anomalies can be observed before the main earthquake and its aftershocks, the first one occurred one month before the mainshock in the epicentral area and its southeast land area, the second one which distributed northwest towards to the subduction zone occurred one week before the mainshock in the sea of southwest of the epicenter and the third one occurred one week before the aftershocks on 15 March 2010 in the sea of southwest of the epicenter and the northern part of the subduction zone. (2) The anomalies appeared firstly in the back-arc region where the volcanic activities were very intense in recent decades, and then propagated to subduction zone and adjacent sea area, that might be the result of the crust deformation of the subduction zone prior to the earthquake. (3) Surface temperature anomalies were found when the SLHF anomaly occurred on the land region. However, there are not any surface temperature anomalies could be mentioned when the SLHF anomaly occurred on the sea, which might be due to high heat capacity of water slowing down the temperature increase.																	0001-5733					JUL	2011	54	7					1738	1744		10.3969/j.issn.0001-5733.2011.07.006								WOS:000293366800006

The field observations in two different seasons allow an exponential empirical model to be used to retrieve suspended-sediment concentration (SSC) from MODIS imagery. Both the field-survey data and the MODIS-derived SSC show that the sediment transport in the southern Bohai Strait has a significant seasonal variation due to the seasonally varying thermohaline structure of the water column and the hydrodynamics resulting from the seasonally alternating monsoons. The SSC in winter is approximately 3-10 times higher than in summer. Considering the seasonal variation of water flux (WF) and SSC, the annual sediment flux (SSF) through the southern Bohai Strait is estimated to be approximately 40.0 Mt yr(-1), about 4-8 times previous estimates, which did not take into account seasonal variation. Although the Huanghe (Yellow River) discharges a large amount of sediment in the summer, the SSF through the southern Bohai Strait in the winter (similar to 32.0 Mt) is about 4 times greater than it is in the summer. The strong seasonal variability of SSF through the southern Bohai Strait indicates that strong resuspension along the coast of the Huanghe delta in winter and enhanced longshore transport by coastal currents due to winter monsoon activity might be the major mechanisms of cross-strait transport of sediment in winter.

Dynamics of chromophoric dissolved organic matter in Mandovi and Zuari estuaries - A study through in situ and satellite data	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING												The spatial and temporal distribution of absorption of chromophoric dissolved organic matter at 440 nm (a(CDOM) (440)) in the Mandovi and Zuari estuaries situated along the west coast of India, has been analysed. The study was carried out using remotely sensed data, obtained from the Ocean Colour Monitor (OCM) on board the Indian Remote Sensing satellite - P4, together with in situ data during the period January to December 2005. Satellite retrieval of CDOM absorption was carried out by applying an algorithm developed for the site. A good correlation (R = 0.98) was obtained between satellite derived CDOM and in situ data. Time series analysis revealed that spatial distribution of CDOM has a direct link with the seasonal hydrodynamics of the estuaries. The effect of remnant fresh water on CDOM distribution could be analysed by delineating a plume in the offshore region of the Zuari estuary. Though fresh water flux from terrestrial input plays a major role in the distribution of CDOM throughout the Mandovi estuary, its role in the Zuari estuary is significant up to the middle zone. Other processes responsible for feeding CDOM in both the estuaries are coastal advection, in situ production and resuspension of bottom settled sediments. The highest value of a(CDOM)(440) was observed in the middle zone of the Mandovi estuary during the post-monsoon season. The relation between a(CDOM)(440) and S (spectral slope coefficient of CDOM) could differentiate CDOM introduced in to estuaries through multiple sources. The algorithm developed for the Mandovi estuary is S = 0.003 [a(CDOM) (440)(-0.7091)] while for the Zuari estuary, S = 0.0031 [a(CDOM) (440)(-.0777)]. respectively.

Impact of North Gas Field development on landuse/landcover changes at Al Khore, North Qatar, using remote sensing and GIS	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												Four dates of satellite images are utilized to monitor landuse/landcover changes at Al Khore municipality following discovering of the North Gas Field at the Northeast coast of the state of Qatar. Ras Laffan Port has been designed and purpose built primarily as the export facility for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) derived from the processing of gas landed from the North Field Gas Reservoir situated 67 km NNE of the Port. Remote sensing data includes, MSS 1977, Landsat Thematic Mapper 1988 and 2000 and IRSS 2008. The rapid increase in population over the last three decades is attributed to the strong performance of the economy. At Al Khore, number of population increases from 31,547, 4.2% of total population in year 2004 to 50,917, 6.1% of total population in year 2006. Production Capacity of Ras Gas from the Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) increases from 6.6 million tons in year 1999 to 35.7 million tons in year 2012. Change detection is processed to assess the impact of Ras Laffan harbour on coastal changes. The most appropriate band combination, band ratios and images classifications were specified to enhance land cover in each image data. ArcGIS.9.3 is used to analyse, map and assess the current urban and regional planning. The results indicate that Al Khore master plan comes in response to rapid development of the state of Qatar, the most suitable regional plan should be suggested for sustainable development.

After the earthquake, the Center for Earth Observation and Digital Earth (CEODE), Chinese Academy of Sciences, quickly launched a major disaster emergency response to assess the disaster. In this paper, we have extracted buildings and farms in the heavily devastated area that includes Iwate, Miyagi, and Fukushima Prefectures, based on multi-spectral remote sensing data. We have assessed building damage by overlaying seismic intensity and building distributions. In addition, we have assessed the extent of building and farm damage caused by the tsunami through the establishment of a tsunami impact assessment model that is based on terrain and distance from the coastline. The results were partially verified by high-resolution images obtained after the disaster. The results show that about 76% of buildings in Miyagi Prefecture were affected by seismic intensity 6 and above, with 24% of the buildings and 12% of the farms destroyed by the tsunami. These huge losses were echoes at lesser amounts in Fukushima and Iwate. The results provide the support of basic data, which can be further developed by economic and social aspects of the disaster assessment.																	1001-6538					JUL	2011	56	20					2138	2144		10.1007/s11434-011-4544-6								WOS:000292271300010

Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer-derived SST and Indian Remote Sensing Satellite-P4 Ocean Color Monitor-derived chlorophyll concentration were used to generate the integrated potential fishing zone (IPFZ) forecast over the east coast of India (16 degrees-22 degrees N, 81 degrees-89 degrees E) during April 7-9 and December 18-21, 2003. The IPFZ forecasts are validated with actual fishing using the Fishery Survey of India fishing vessels. Furthermore, we analyze Naval Research Laboratory Layered Ocean Model circulations and Jason-1-derived sea surface height anomalies in the IPFZs to report the presence of cyclonic eddies which induce upwelling and enhance biological productivity, leading to active aggregation of fish schools. The use of accurate mesoscale eddy-simulating models could be useful in the long-term prediction of pelagic fish schools.																	1545-598X					JUL	2011	8	4					789	793		10.1109/LGRS.2010.2096554								WOS:000292105300042

These anomalies, located atop hills and mountains, were hypothesized prehispanic fortifications. A sample of remotely identified anomalies was ground truthed in the Huaura and Fortaleza Valleys on the Central Coast of Peril. 140 positive anomalies were documented and assessed using a simple defensibility index.

Lack of accurate mapping and its overall high costs represent some of the major difficulties for successful detection and subsequent environmental management. Remote sensing techniques could provide a quicker, more accurate and more cost efficient approach to mapping these invasive species. In order to allow for classification of remotely sensed data, we have collected and analyzed hyperspectral reflectance profiles of both invasive Caulerpa species in the Adriatic and the native Caulerpa cf. laetevirens species from the southeastern Atlantic coast of the United States. We have measured distinctive spectral features for spectroscopically distinguishing between these species, which is particularly interesting in the areas where these native and invasive species coexist. The initial results suggest that it might be possible to distinguish between the species based on their spectral reflectance profile. These results would have to be verified with samples taken from more populations in different phenological phases of the seaweed growth and other environmental conditions.

During September (8, 20, 22, 24 and 30) 2003, high dense algal bloom patches (chl>20 mg/m(3)) were seen around the Calicut coast in the OCM images and spreads across the Kerala coast in the shelf water up to 20-30 km from coastline. Water colour has been found even green due to toxic micro algae Hornelia marina. Water quality parameters like SST, dissolved oxygen, salinity, pH, productivity and nutrients have been correlated with the bloom phenomenon.																	0379-5136					JUN	2011	40	3					356	364										WOS:000295430800006

Optical Remote Sensing - A Review for Remote Predictive Geological Mapping in Northern Canada	GEOSCIENCE CANADA												Optical remotely sensed data have broad application for geological mapping in Canada's North. Diverse remote sensors and digital image processing techniques have specific map-ping functions, as demonstrated by numerous examples and associated interpretations. Moderate resolution optical sensors are useful for discriminating rock types, whereas sensors that offer increased spectral resolution (i.e. hyperspectral sensors) allow the geologist to identify certain rock types (mainly different types of carbonates, Fe-bearing rocks, sulphates and hydroxyl(clay-) bearing rocks) as opposed to merely discriminating between them. Increased spatial resolution and the ability to visualize the earth's surface in stereo are now offered by a host of optical sensors. However, the usefulness of optical remote sensing for geological mapping is highly dependent on the geologic, surficial and biophysical environment, and bedrock predictive mapping is most successful in areas not obscured by thick drift and vegetation/lichen cover, which is typical of environments proximal to coasts. In general, predictive mapping of surficial materials has fewer restrictions. Optical imagery can be enhanced in a variety of ways and fused with other geoscience datasets to produce imagery that can be visually interpreted in a GIS environment. Computer processing techniques are useful for undertaking more quantitative analyses of imagery for mapping bedrock, surficial materials and geomorphic or glacial features.																	0315-0941					JUN	2011	38	2					49	83										WOS:000295108100001

Application of Remote Sensing in Studying Holocene Sediments and Tectonic Episodes at Kelshi, Ratnagiri District, Maharashtra, India	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												Kelshi is a coastal village, located on the southern bank of the Bharja river in Dapoli taluka of Ratnagiri district. All along the coast occurs a habitation site which is overlaid by a sand deposit having a thickness of +20 m. The archaeological artifacts collected around the site are found to be significant in understanding the antiquity of the site. It also substantiates that, human occupation survived here for seven centuries. Remote sensing data interpretation carried out has revealed the existence of three lineaments in this area. In the field, the lineaments have been confirmed as faulted surfaces and the magnitude of the movements along are measurable. A geophysical survey was conducted by using ABEM WADI equipment for confirmation of outcome of the aerial-photo interpretation. It confirms that the area had undergone three tectonic activities after 1524 A.D. The inferences based on the investigations convinced us to study the historical seismicity of this region. A comprehensive and exhaustive investigation in such areas is necessary to know the evolution of the west coast of India and the tectonic activity during the late Holocene.																	0255-660X					JUN	2011	39	2					241	247		10.1007/s12524-011-0087-1								WOS:000293960200012

Similar morphological forms have been described as long-shore sand waves associated with high energy coasts. This article presents the results of field geological and geomorphological studies and retrospective analyses of remote sensing data (air- and satellite photos of on-shore and near-shore parts of the coastal zone). The development of the long-shore sand waves in the study area is explained by the fact that prevailing waves induced by the westerly winds propagate almost parallel to the coast. It is shown that under these conditions the shoreline contours become unstable and any small perturbations to the shoreline extend these contours with time.

The surveyed area covered approximately 270 km(2), along 80 km of the Southeast coast of Portugal. The acoustic data were acquired with a single beam ground discrimination system (QTC VIEW, Series V), connected to a dual frequency echo sounder (50 and 200 kHz). Sediment grain size and macrofaunal community data were obtained by grab sampling at 88 sites. The sedimentary and the biological data were subjected to classification and ordination analysis and the acoustic data obtained with the two frequencies were analyzed individually with the QTC IMPACT (v3.4) software and classified into acoustic classes. The affinity groups obtained with the three datasets were mapped using a Geographic Information System. The study area showed an inshore-offshore pattern with sands ranging from very fine to very coarse, revealing a sediment distribution in the near-shore shelf comprised by two main areas; a very fine/fine sand area up to 7-10 m depth and a very coarse/coarse sand area offshore. In turn, the biological data also showed an inshore-offshore pattern, identifying two main biological assemblages: fine/very fine sand and coarse/very coarse sand communities. Furthermore, the biological pattern clearly reflected the hydrodynamic conditions of the area, from highly hydrodynamic shallow depth to the calmer deeper areas. Accordingly, species richness and densities were lower at shallow areas than at deeper depth. The acoustic data identified the prevailing biosedimentary gradients along the inshore-offshore direction. Overall, the results obtained here showed that the acoustic system could identify two main areas based on sediment grain size, which closely related to the two main biological communities (groups A and B). This study indicates the importance of combining several layers of information in order to increase the spatial resolution of the main biotope distribution (validating the acoustic data) and detail their subdivisions (ground-truth sampling). Furthermore, we show that designing ground-truth samples on the basis of the acoustic diversity data allows the biological data to "speak" for itself. In general, acoustic techniques are used as a means to optimize ground-truth sampling. This will only be valid if acoustics can capture all the essence of biotope heterogeneity. If this is not the case, special attention should be given when using broad scale methods (acoustic remote sensing) devoted to biotope mapping. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Blending Geospatial Technology and Traditional Ecological Knowledge to Enhance Restoration Decision-Support Processes in Coastal Louisiana	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												BETHEL, M.B.; BRIEN, L.F.; DANIELSON, E.J.; LASKA, S.B.; TROUTMAN, J.P.; BOSHART, W.M.; GIARDINO, M.J., and PHILLIPS, M.A., 2011. Blending geospatial technology and traditional ecological knowledge to enhance restoration decision-support processes in coastal Louisiana. Journal of Coastal Research, 27(3), 555-571. West Palm Beach (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. More informed coastal restoration decisions have become increasingly important given limited resources available for restoration projects and the increasing magnitude of marsh degradation and loss across the Gulf Coast. This research investigated the feasibility and benefits of integrating geospatial technology with the traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) of an indigenous Louisiana coastal population to assess the impacts of current and historical ecosystem change on community viability. The primary goal was to provide coastal resource managers with a decision-support tool that allows for a more comprehensive method of assessing localized ecological change in the Gulf Coast region, which can also benefit human community sustainability. Using remote sensing (RS) and geographic information systems (GIS) mapping products, integrated with a coastal community's TEK to achieve this goal, the research team determined a method for producing vulnerability/sustainability mapping products for an ecosystem-dependent livelihood base of a coastal population based on information derived from RS imagery prioritized with TEK. This study also demonstrates how such an approach can engage affected community residents who are interested in determining and addressing the causes and mitigating the decline of marsh habitat. Historical image data sets of the study area were acquired to understand evolution of land change to current conditions and project future vulnerability. Image-processing procedures were developed and applied to produce maps that detail land change in the study area at time intervals from 1968 to 2009. This information was combined in a GIS with acquired TEK and scientific data sets relating to marsh vegetation health and vulnerability characteristics to produce mapping products that provide new information for use in the coastal restoration decision-making process. This information includes: (1) marsh areas that are most vulnerable; and (2) the areas that are most significant to community sustainability.																	0749-0208					MAY	2011	27	3					555	571		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-10-00138.1								WOS:000290645600016

Predicting habitat to optimize sampling of Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax)	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												More than 40 years after the collapse of the fishery for Pacific sardine, a renewed fishery has emerged off the west coasts of the United States and Canada. The daily egg production method (DEPM) and acoustic-trawl surveys are performed annually and, to minimize the uncertainties in the estimates, sampling effort needs to be allocated optimally. Here, based on a 12-year dataset including the presence/absence of sardine eggs and concomitant remotely sensed oceanographic variables, a probabilistic generalized additive model is developed to predict spatio-temporal distributions of habitat for the northern stock of Pacific sardine in the California Current. Significant relationships are identified between eggs and sea surface temperature, chlorophyll a concentration, and the gradient of sea surface altitude. The model accurately predicts the habitat and seasonal migration pattern of sardine, irrespective of spawning condition. The predictions of potential habitat are validated extensively by fishery landings and net-sample data from the northeast Pacific. The predicted habitat can be used to optimize the time and location of the DEPM, acoustic-trawl, and aerial surveys of sardine. The method developed and illustrated may be applicable too to studies of other stocks of sardine and other epipelagic fish in other eastern boundary, upwelling regions.																	1054-3139					MAY	2011	68	5					867	879		10.1093/icesjms/fsr038								WOS:000289582900007						
J	Kuenzer, C; Bluemel, A; Gebhardt, S; Quoc, TV; Dech, S				Kuenzer, Claudia; Bluemel, Andrea; Gebhardt, Steffen; Tuan Vo Quoc; Dech, Stefan			Remote Sensing of Mangrove Ecosystems: A Review	REMOTE SENSING												Mangrove ecosystems dominate the coastal wetlands of tropical and subtropical regions throughout the world. They provide various ecological and economical ecosystem services contributing to coastal erosion protection, water filtration, provision of areas for fish and shrimp breeding, provision of building material and medicinal ingredients, and the attraction of tourists, amongst many other factors. At the same time, mangroves belong to the most threatened and vulnerable ecosystems worldwide and experienced a dramatic decline during the last half century. International programs, such as the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands or the Kyoto Protocol, underscore the importance of immediate protection measures and conservation activities to prevent the further loss of mangroves. In this context, remote sensing is the tool of choice to provide spatio-temporal information on mangrove ecosystem distribution, species differentiation, health status, and ongoing changes of mangrove populations. Such studies can be based on various sensors, ranging from aerial photography to high- and medium-resolution optical imagery and from hyperspectral data to active microwave (SAR) data. Remote-sensing techniques have demonstrated a high potential to detect, identify, map, and monitor mangrove conditions and changes during the last two decades, which is reflected by the large number of scientific papers published on this topic. To our knowledge, a recent review paper on the remote sensing of mangroves does not exist, although mangrove ecosystems have become the focus of attention in the context of current climate change and discussions of the services provided by these ecosystems. Also, climate change-related remote-sensing studies in coastal zones have increased drastically in recent years. The aim of this review paper is to provide a comprehensive overview and sound summary of all of the work undertaken, addressing the variety of remotely sensed data applied for mangrove ecosystem mapping, as well as the numerous methods and techniques used for data analyses, and to further discuss their potential and limitations.																	2072-4292					MAY	2011	3	5					878	928		10.3390/rs3050878								WOS:000306749500004

Considering the success of this project, the Commission has financed another more ambitious project in which 11 countries and 23 research and educational institutions have been involved. The project was called Participatory multi-Level EO-assisted tools for Irrigation water management and Agricultural Decision-Support, (PLEIADeS), and Mexico was one of the beneficiaries. This project was established during the period from 2006 to 2009, in the State of Sonora, in northern Mexico,, and the main objective, among several others, was to support the producers of the irrigation districts in this state, in order to improve the use of water in land irrigation. Related to this project, some of the technologies developed in Europe were tested and adapted in three Irrigation Districts, the Hermosillo Coast, the Mayo River and the Yaqui River. Using information from several water users from these districts, the methodologies have been tested and adapted to evaluate the development of the wheat crop using images from satellites Landsat 5 and 7. In this study, some functions have been obtained, correlating vegetation indices and evapotranspiration to crop yield, which make it possible to evaluate the effect of water applied to soil and input management. Also the System of Participatory Information Decision Support and Expert knowledge for River basin management (SPIDER), was adapted for the use of water users. The results of this study show the possibility of developing methodologies to transfer information to the water users which can be useful to improve soil, water and input management to get better crop yields.

J	Narayana, AC				Narayana, A. C.			Tectonic geomorphology, tsunamis and environmental hazards: reference to Andaman-Nicobar Islands	NATURAL HAZARDS												Geomorphic features associated with earthquakes and tsunamis have received wide attention in estimating uplift and subsidence after the tectonic event. Although various techniques are in vogue in estimating the uplift and subsidence after the 2004 Andaman-Sumatra earthquake and subsequent tsunami, remote sensing techniques have been proved to be quite handy to study the geomorphic changes. In the present study, geomorphic changes associated with the destructive event of December 2004 have been analyzed. The emergent and subsident coasts around the smaller islands in the Andaman region have been identified. The coral reef area that has been subjected to uplift or subsidence in some of the islands of the Andaman and Nicobar region is delineated, and the net areal extents of these coral beds have been computed. Of the six islands studied in Andaman region, coral reef of four islands was subjected to uplift, and around two islands the area was subsided. The uplifted area varied from 0.10 to 11 km(2), and subsidence was about 0.50 km(2). In Nicobar region, the subsidence of coral reefs was recorded. This study helps to monitor the coastal environments and the destruction due to natural hazards.																	0921-030X					APR	2011	57	1					65	82		10.1007/s11069-010-9647-x								WOS:000290036100006						
J	Le Henaff, M; Roblou, L; Bouffard, J				Le Henaff, Matthieu; Roblou, Laurent; Bouffard, Jerome			Characterizing the Navidad current interannual variability using coastal altimetry	OCEAN DYNAMICS												In this study, the Navidad current, which flows along the northern coast of Spain in winter, is observed and characterized using coastal altimetry data over the period 1992-2002. This coastal current, marked by a strong interannual variability, is associated with eastward transport of warm waters along the shelf slope. Specific data editing and processing strategies have been applied to the along-track altimeter data, which allows us to retrieve altimetric sea level anomalies closer to the coast, with a better spatial coverage and improved quality when compared with standard altimetric products. The current variability observed upstream by in situ time series after November 1996 is well reproduced by the satellite across-track surface geostrophic current anomalies up until September 1999; this agreement degrades later in time. The combined use of satellite-derived current anomalies and sea-surface temperature anomalies allows us to develop indices of Navidad occurrences, in the first long-term, systematic survey of that current based on a multi-sensor approach. The satellite analyses confirm the previously identified Navidad occurrences in winter of 1995-1996, 1997-1998, and 2000-2001. Furthermore, a weak Navidad event was identified in winter 1996-1997. These four winters are associated with a negative North Atlantic Oscillation index in the previous fall, but the intensity of the Navidad is not correlated to the amplitude of that index.

In the current research, the site suitability investigation for rating the different environmental, geological, and geotechnical conditions facing civil engineering projects were assessed using a geographic information system (GIS) multi-criteria approach. The study area is one of the most promising areas for urban and touristic as well as industrial developments in Egypt, which is located on the NW coast of the Gulf of Suez. This area may face several geo-environmental problems that will limit its suitability for civil projects. Weighted GIS model, which integrates different types of data sources, such as land use/cover, geological, geomorphological, geophysical, environmental, remote sensing, and field data, can be achieved to create a site suitability map. In this paper, an analytical hierarchy process approach has been used to develop the weighted model for different factors. As a result of this study, areas of potential geotechnical and geo-environmental hazards that could impact the design and construction of civil projects were identified. Therefore, changes can be made early in the design process before significant design efforts are being invested.

Assessment and management of coastal multi-hazard vulnerability along the Cuddalore-Villupuram, east coast of India using geospatial techniques	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												The current study area is coastal zone of Cuddalore, Pondicherry and Villupuram districts of the Tamil Nadu along the southeast coast of India. This area is experiencing threat from many disasters such as storm, cyclone, flood, tsunami and erosion. This was one of the worst affected area during 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and during 2008 Nisha cyclone. The multi-hazard vulnerability maps prepared here are a blended and combined overlay of multiple hazards those affecting the coastal zone. The present study aims to develop a methodology for coastal multi-hazard vulnerability assessment. This study was carried out using parameters probability of maximum storm surge height during the return period (mean recurrence interval), future sea level rise, coastal erosion and high resolution coastal topography with the aid of the Remote Sensing and GIS tools. The assessment results were threatening 3.46 million inhabitants from 129 villages covering a coastal area 360 km(2) under the multi-hazard zone. In general river systems act as the flooding corridors which carrying larger and longer hinterland inundation. Multi-hazard Vulnerability maps were further reproduced as risk maps with the land use information. These risk caused due to multi-hazards were assessed up to building levels. The decision-making tools presented here can aid as critical information during a disaster for the evacuation process and to evolve a management strategy. These Multi-hazard vulnerability maps can also be used as a tool in planning a new facility and for insurance purpose. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Time series of satellite-derived surface chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl) in 1997-2009 were used to examine for trends in the timing of the annual phytoplankton bloom maximum. Significant trends towards earlier phytoplankton blooms were detected in about 11% of the area of the Arctic Ocean with valid Chl data, e.g. in the Hudson Bay, Foxe Basin, Baffin Sea, off the coasts of Greenland, in the Kara Sea and around Novaya Zemlya. These areas roughly coincide with areas where ice concentration has decreased in early summer (June), thus making the earlier blooms possible. In the selected areas, the annual phytoplankton bloom maximum has advanced by up to 50 days which may have consequences for the Arctic food chain and carbon cycling. Outside the Arctic, the annual Chl maximum has become earlier in boreal North Pacific but later in the North Atlantic.

Mesquite encroachment impact on southern New Mexico rangelands: remote sensing and geographic information systems approach	JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING												Honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa Torr.) invasion can negatively impact grazing capacity, spatial livestock distribution, and forage production in Chihuahuan Desert rangelands. High spatial resolution remote sensing data can be used to develop maps of shrub encroachment for arid rangelands. The objective of this study was to map changes in honey mesquite abundance and to evaluate honey mesquite impacts on perennial grass production at the Chihuahuan Desert Rangeland Research Center in south-central New Mexico using high resolution satellite imagery. The project employed QuickBird ortho-ready satellite imagery with spatial resolution of 2.4 m in multispectral bands and panchromatic resolution of 0.6 m for the study area on May 19, 2009. We used a maximum likelihood supervised classification algorithm to distinguish honey mesquite from other land cover categories. We then measured grass production (kg/ha) in May, 2009 on 10 permanent, evenly spaced key areas in each pasture. We identified 12x60 m plots from the classified map and used these to calculate honey mesquite canopy cover on the 40 transects across the study area. Areas classified as dominated by honey mesquite estimated from image analyses encompassed 143, 50, 92, and 136 hectares in pastures 1, 4, 14, and 15, respectively. Regression analyses showed that increasing levels of honey mesquite canopy cover corresponded to lower perennial grass forage production (r(2) = 0.73, n = 40). Our findings indicate that classification of high-resolution satellite imagery is a very useful tool for mapping invasive shrubs and determining their influence on forage production in desert landscapes.

Comparison of model results with ground and remote-sensing data	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												The effect of irrigation on regional climate has been studied over the years. However, in most studies, the model was usually set at coarse resolution, and the soil moisture was set to field capacity at each time step. We reinvestigated this issue over the Central Valley of California's agricultural area by: (1) using the regional climate model at different resolutions down to the finest resolution of 4 km for the most inner domain, covering California's Central Valley, the central coast, the Sierra Nevada Mountains, and water; (2) using a more realistic irrigation scheme in the model through the use of different allowable soil water depletion configurations; and (3) evaluating the simulated results against satellite and in situ observations available through the California Irrigation Management Information System (CIMIS). The simulation results with fine model resolution and with the more realistic irrigation scheme indicate that the surface meteorological fields are noticeably improved when compared with observations from the CIMIS network and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data. Our results also indicate that irrigation has significant impacts on local meteorological fields by decreasing temperature by 3 degrees-7 degrees C and increasing relative humidity by 9-20%, depending on model resolutions and allowable soil water depletion configurations. More significantly, our results using the improved model show that the effects of irrigation on weather and climate do not extend very far into nonirrigated regions.				sorooshian, soroosh/B-3753-2008	sorooshian, soroosh/0000-0001-7774-5113												2169-897X					MAR 16	2011	116									10.1029/2010JD014775								WOS:000288605100001

Study on the utility of IRS 1D LISS-III data and the classification techniques for mapping of Sunderban mangroves	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION												Mangrove conservation and management is a stupendous task chiefly due to the inaccessibility and the hostile substrate conditions. Remote sensing technology serves as an important tool in providing fast, accurate and up-to-date baseline information on the status of mangroves. It is almost impossible to carry out conventional field surveys in these swampy areas. The present study aims at the classification and mapping of the mangroves in Sunderban Biosphere Reserve (SBR) in the West Bengal province of India using IRS 1D LISS-III satellite data. Different classification approaches, viz., on-screen visual interpretation, supervised and unsupervised classifications were tried. The study showed that four mangroves classes, viz., Avicennia, Phoenix, mixed mangroves, and mangrove scrub and eight non-mangrove classes could be delineated using all the three approaches. All the mangrove and non-mangrove classes were field verified and the overall accuracy as well as user's and producer's accuracies for each category were determined. It was observed that among the three approaches, on-screen visual interpretation yielded higher classification accuracy (91.67%) compared to supervised (79.90%) and unsupervised classifications (71.08%). The results obtained through on-screen visual interpretation showed that all mangrove categories together cover 23.21% of the total geographical area of SBR, of which the mixed mangrove category covers maximum area (18.31%). Among the non-mangrove classes, the waterbody occupies largest area (35.36%) followed by agriculture (34.51%).

J	Allen, TR; Oertel, G; McLeod, G				Allen, Thomas Richard; Oertel, George; McLeod, George			Synoptic Assessment of Repletion and Residual Water Dynamics in a Coastal Lagoon by Thermal Remote Sensing: Great Machipongo Lagoon (Hog Island Bay), Virginia, USA	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING												Coastal lagoons are prominent features along many of the worlds sand coasts. Unlike estuaries, a large amount of lagoon volume is exchanged via tidal draining and repletion. We sought to quantify the repletion and residual water volumes in a coastal lagoon using satellite remote sensing. In the Great Machipongo Lagoon approximately 53% of the basin capacity drains out with each ebb tide, leaving a residual volume of about 47%. While the repletion footprint indicates the area of the lagoon that is completely flushed with each tide, residual water flushes at a much slower rate. The footprint of repletion water at full tide covers about 30% of the outer part of the lagoon. A fraction of the residual water is entrained into the repletion water mass along the plume frontal boundary. This allows a relatively small percent of the residual water to be exchanged with the coastal ocean. Thermal responses in ASTER imagery indicate zonation as well as areas of continuous mixing of repletion and residual waters. Comparison of remote sensing data with the tidal volume suggests that about 2-4% of the residual water mass is entrained along the frontal boundary during each tidal cycle and flushing of the residual water mass takes about 25-50 tidal cycles. The overall approach portends further application of thermal satellite remote sensing for monitoring estuarine and lagoon flushing and repletion.																	1939-1404					MAR	2011	4	1					147	158		10.1109/JSTARS.2010.2070488								WOS:000288678800018						
J	Hallet, B; Sletten, R; Whilden, K				Hallet, Bernard; Sletten, Ron; Whilden, Kevin			Micro-relief development in polygonal patterned ground in the Dry Valleys of Antarctica	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Polygonal patterned ground in polar regions of both Earth and Mars has received considerable attention. In comparison with the size, shape, and arrangement of the polygons, the diverse micro-relief and topography (termed here simply "relief") of polygonal patterned ground have been understudied. And yet, the relief reflects important conditions and processes occurring directly below the ground surface, and it can be observed readily in the field and through remote sensing. Herein, we describe the relief characteristic of the simplest and relatively young form of patterned ground in the Dry Valleys of Antarctic. We also develop a numerical model to examine the generation of relief due to subsurface material being shouldered aside contraction cracks by incremental sand wedges growth, and to down-slope creep of loose granular material on the surface. We model the longterm subsurface deformation of ice-cemented permafrost as a non-linear viscous material. Our modeling is guided and validated using decades of field measurements of surface displacements of the permafrost and relief. This work has implications for assessing the activity of surfaces on Earth and Mars, and much larger scale potential manifestations of incremental wedging in icy material, namely the distinct paired ridges on Europa.

The spatial variability of shoreline changes are studied using IRS 1B LISS-II 1991, IRS 1C LISS-III 2004 and IRS P6 LISS-IV and IRS 1D PAN merge data 2006. The corresponding Survey of India toposheets of 1852, 1972 and survey and land record village map of 1918 also supplemented for this study. The kind and extent of shoreline changes were investigated by using GPS during ground truth verification. The results are analyzed and presented in this paper. The study results revealed that 180 m receding of the shoreline occurred in the past 155 years.																	0255-660X					MAR	2011	39	1					107	115		10.1007/s12524-010-0052-4								WOS:000291952500009

TECTONICS												An open problem concerning the Mw 7.4, 1999 Izmit earthquake along the North Anatolian Fault (NAF) system is the apparent conflict between estimates of strike-slip deformation based on field and remote sensing data. This is due to the fact that the main strand of the NAF west of the epicenter lies below the Sea of Marmara. Seismological evidence and models based on synthetic aperture radar interferometry suggest that coseismic and early postseismic displacement accumulated after the earthquake could have reached the western end of the Izmit Gulf and possibly the southern edge of the Cinarcik Basin, tapering off along the northern coast of the Armutlu Peninsula, more than 60 km from the epicenter. This scenario is not confirmed by onshore field observations that point toward a termination of the surface rupture around 30 km to the east. These discrepancies convey high uncertainties in the estimate of the tectonic load produced by the Izmit earthquake on the adjacent fault segment toward Istanbul. We analyzed data from different sources, including high-resolution marine geophysical surveys and two Nautile dives along the fault-controlled canyon that connects Izmit Cinarcik basins. Our observations suggest that the surface rupture of the 1999 Izmit earthquake propagated through the shallow Gulf but did not reach the deep Marmara basins. In fact, along the slope between Cinarcik and the western end of the Izmit Gulf, we do not observe fault-related ruptures affecting the sea-floor but rather a series of active gas seeps and "black patches" that mark the presence of known active faults. Our findings have implications for seismic risk assessment in the highly populated region of Istanbul, both for the estimate of tectonic load transferred to the next fault segments and the location of the next earthquake.

The optical efficiency of flocs in shelf seas and estuaries	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												A correct understanding of the way in which light interacts with suspended particles is essential for quantitative interpretation of satellite visible band imagery of turbid shelf seas and estuaries. In this paper we describe new optical observations at 90 stations in the tidally energetic waters along the south and west coasts of Britain. The cross sectional area of the particles in suspension has been measured with a LISST laser diffraction instrument. Light scattering and absorption coefficients have been determined by applying Kirk's method to radiometric measurements, at 6 wavelengths. Results show that the scattering coefficient increases linearly with particle cross sectional area A per unit volume of water with a slope (scattering efficiency) of 1.96 (standard error 0.08) at 665 nm. Particle absorption coefficients a(P) also increase with particle cross sectional area but at the most turbid stations, particle absorption per unit area (a(P)/A) is observed to increase with the mean size of the particles in suspension. The particles are mostly mineral flocs which become more opaque as they grow larger and the photon path length through them increases. The implication of these results for remote sensing is that reflectance in the red part of the spectrum, which mainly depends on light scattering, is proportional to the cross sectional area of particles in suspension. Reflectance measurements in the green and blue parts of the spectrum, where particle absorption becomes more important, depend on the diameter of the particles as well as their cross sectional area. We show that simultaneous measurements of reflectance in the red and green parts of the spectrum can be used to derive both the area and size of the particles in suspension. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Remote sensing with SPOT-4 for mapping kelp forests in turbid waters on the south European Atlantic shelf	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Remote sensing has become an increasingly used technique for the thematic mapping of large marine areas. In recent years, many researchers have successfully applied these techniques in different places for benthic mapping in clear waters: however, areas with turbid waters present important limitations that are gradually being solved by recent technological advances. In this context, the main objective of the present study is to develop and validate a methodology for mapping intertidal and subtidal kelp forests in the Galician coast (NW Spain), based on images from SPOT-4 (Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre). Three analysis methods have been applied: visual analysis and interpretation, unsupervised classification (cluster) and supervised classification (angular classification and maximum likelihood classification). Classification percentages higher than 70% in all substrates were obtained both using visual analysis and interpretation and maximum likelihood classification. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Satellite remote sensing of mangrove forests: Recent advances and future opportunities	PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												Mangroves are salt tolerant woody plants that form highly productive intertidal ecosystems in tropical and subtropical regions. Despite the established importance of mangroves to the coastal environment, including fisheries, deforestation continues to be a major threat due to pressures for wood and forest products, land conversion to aquaculture, and coastal urban development. Over the past 15 years, remote sensing has played a crucial role in mapping and understanding changes in the areal extent and spatial pattern of mangrove forests related to natural disasters and anthropogenic forces. This paper reviews recent advancements in remote-sensed data and techniques and describes future opportunities for integration or fusion of these data and techniques for large-scale monitoring in mangroves as a consequence of anthropogenic and climatic forces. While traditional pixel-based classification of Landsat, SPOT, and ASTER imagery has been widely applied for mapping mangrove forest, more recent types of imagery such as very high resolution (VHR), Polarmetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR), hyperspectral, and LiDAR systems and the development of techniques such as Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA), spatial image analysis (e.g. image texture), Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR), and machine-learning algorithms have demonstrated the potential for reliable and detailed characterization of mangrove forests including species, leaf area, canopy height, and stand biomass. Future opportunities include the application of existing sensors such as the hyperspectral HYPERION, the application of existing methods from terrestrial forest remote sensing, investigation of new sensors such as ALOS PRISM and PALSAR, and overcoming challenges to the global monitoring of mangrove forests such as wide-scale data availability, robust and consistent methods, and capacity-building with scientists and organizations in developing countries.																	0309-1333	1477-0296				FEB	2011	35	1					87	108		10.1177/0309133310385371								WOS:000287779900005						
J	Dunhill, AM				Dunhill, Alexander M.			Using remote sensing and a geographic information system to quantify rock exposure area in England and Wales: Implications for paleodiversity studies	GEOLOGY												Rock outcrop area and number of sedimentary formations have been widely used as sampling proxies in paleodiversity studies and have often been found to correlate with apparent paleodiversity. However, rock exposure area is a better proxy for the amount of sedimentary rock available for study than the widely used measures of outcrop area (i.e., map area) or number of formations. With the use of remote sensing and a geographic information system (GIS), it is possible to quantify rock exposure area accurately on a regional scale. Rock exposure area does not correlate well with either outcrop area or number of sedimentary formations, and the proportion of rock exposed in different areas can vary considerably with proximity to the coast, bedrock age, lithology, land use, and elevation. Therefore, this suggests that the correlation of paleodiversity and rock volume estimates is best explained by a common-cause hypothesis, rather than a geologic sampling bias hypothesis. GIS methods offer an efficient and accurate method of quantifying regional sedimentary rock exposure and may provide a helpful approach to assessing rock record bias on patterns in the fossil record.																	0091-7613					FEB	2011	39	2					111	114		10.1130/G31503.1								WOS:000286505300004

Long-term evaluation of three satellite ocean color algorithms for identifying harmful algal blooms (Karenia brevis) along the west coast of Florida: A matchup assessment	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												We present a simple algorithm to identify Karenia brevis blooms in the Gulf of Mexico along the west coast of Florida in satellite imagery. It is based on an empirical analysis of collocated matchups of satellite and in situ measurements. The results of this Empirical Approach is compared to those of a Bio-optical Technique - taken from the published literature - and the Operational Method currently implemented by the NOAA Harmful Algal Bloom Forecasting System for K. brevis blooms. These three algorithms are evaluated using a multi-year MODIS data set (from July, 2002 to October, 2006) and a long-term in situ database. Matchup pairs, consisting of remotely-sensed ocean color parameters and near-coincident field measurements of K. brevis concentration, are used to assess the accuracy of the algorithms. Fair evaluation of the algorithms was only possible in the central west Florida shelf (i.e. between 25.75 degrees N and 28.25 degrees N) during the boreal Summer and Fall months (i.e. July to December) due to the availability of valid cloud-free matchups. Even though the predictive values of the three algorithms are similar, the statistical measure of success in red tide identification (defined as cell counts in excess of 1.5 x 10(4) cells L(-1)) varied considerably (sensitivity - Empirical: 86%; Bio-optical: 77%; Operational: 26%), as did their effectiveness in identifying non-bloom cases (specificity Empirical: 53%; Bio-optical: 65%; Operational: 84%). As the Operational Method had an elevated frequency of false-negative cases (i.e. presented low accuracy in detecting known red tides), and because of the considerable overlap between the optical characteristics of the red tide and non-bloom population, only the other two algorithms underwent a procedure for further inspecting possible detection improvements. Both optimized versions of the Empirical and Bio-optical algorithms performed similarly, being equally specific and sensitive (similar to 70% for both) and showing low levels of uncertainties (i.e. few cases of false-negatives and false-positives: similar to 30%) improved positive predictive values (similar to 60%) were also observed along with good negative predictive values (similar to 80%).

Video and field observations of wave attenuation in a muddy surf zone	MARINE GEOLOGY												Besides the different scales within which coastal processes manifest their energy, the majority of the world's coastal regions exhibit forms of sediment heterogeneity that are physically significant. One example of a heterogeneous environment is Cassino beach, located at the southernmost part of Brazil, a fine-grain-sized sandy beach where fluid mud sporadically is transported to the nearshore and eventually onto the beach. At this site in 2005, as part of a field experiment, a video system was installed. Three years after the installation, a large mud transgression event took place in February 2008 and had 5 km of extension. In this context, the goal of the present work is to characterize the mud deposition pattern across the surf zone, describing the consequences of mud on nearshore dynamics using remote sensing techniques, beach profiles and suspended matter concentration. The surveyed beach profiles registered the deposition of fluid mud at the inner surf zone with concentrations up to 12 mg/l. The material was deposited close to the shoreline and had a cross-shore width of 100 m during the first deposition day occupying the entire water column. From surf zone time series of pixel intensity, it was possible to detect the attenuation of the surface wave spectra due to the presence of fluid mud. The combination of video techniques and field data allowed one to follow the formation of a double-layer system, where fluid mud overlays the sandy bottom. The video-based system at Cassino demonstrated that remote detection of fluid mud and quantification of its effect on the nearshore dynamics is feasible. The combination of beach profiles, measurements of suspended matter concentration and intensity timestacks allowed the analysis of the short-term evolution of the mud depositional processes.

Grosseto, Tuscany, Italy, ISSN 0749-0208. Beach hydromorphological classification is a complex subject. Different beach classification models were presented by several authors. However, fundamental parameters are usually unavailable. Therefore, a morphological analysis using remotely sensed data and image processing techniques is a good approach to identify and to classify beach hydromorphologies. Remote sensing data is an increasingly important component of natural resources monitoring programs. Its usefulness can be maximized by understanding the constraints and capabilities of the imagery and change detection techniques, related to the monitoring objectives. The aim of this study was to explore different remotely sensed data (aerial photographs and a satellite image) and different image processing algorithms in order to identify coastal forms/patterns and further classify beach hydromorphological stage. To achieve that, different image processing techniques were applied to remotely sensed data: pixel and object-based classification algorithms and a pattern recognition approach using artificial neural networks. A stretch of the northwest coast of Portugal was chosen as the study area. The data used in this study consisted in aerial photographs and an IKONOS-2 image. Based on the obtained results two main conclusions could be taken: the pixel-based classification (supervised classification algorithms) showed better results than the object-based classification algorithms; and the pattern recognition approach is the most effective and accurate methodology. Therefore, the association of remote sensing data and image processing techniques is very useful in identifying coastal forms/patterns regarding the classification of beach morphological stage.

Journal of Coastal Research, SI 64 (Proceedings of the 11th International Coastal Symposium), 1268 - 1271. Szczecin, Poland, ISSN 0749-0208 Mangrove ecosystem changes are commonly mentioned among a variety of coastal effects caused by climate change and human intervention. On the Rio Grande do Norte northern coast of Brazil intense sediment transport, is controlled by a high dynamic energy factors. This causes widespread erosion and shoreline morphological instability. Through the observation of wetland natural deposits, it was possible to make a physicochemical characterization which indicated over an area of approximately 0.89 km(2) appropriated to reforestation with local mangrove. To assess the amount of atmospheric carbon sequestration by the mangrove ecosystem, following the principles of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), an inventory was conducted based on geoprocessing and ground accuracy techniques, especially regarding the structural characterization of the mangrove areas. With this approach a mangrove planting project is planned to stabilize a tidal channel northwest of Ponta do Tubarao Island. This is expected to reduce the energy of the channel which is responsible for the currently intense erosion and migration of the channel over the oil field infrastructure. Remote sensing, GIS and DGPS were used to compare the current and past mangrove cover, allowing plausible projections for the future impacts and changes in that region. Currently 7.1% of the mangrove forests of the studied area is dead or suffering ongoing breakdown.																	0749-0208	1551-5036					2011			2		64		1268	1271										WOS:000302825000048

Journal of Coastal Research, SI 64 (Proceedings of the 11th International Coastal Symposium), 1653 - 1657. Szczecin, Poland, ISSN 0749-0208 The sedimentary environments of tidal flats on the west coast of Korea are subjected to continuous change due to both natural and artificial causes. Thus, knowledge of the spatial distribution of surface sediments in a tidal flat is important in understanding the nature of coastal environmental change. This paper reports on a preliminary study of a novel approach to classifying the surface sedimentary facies in a tidal flat. A map of sedimentary facies was compiled by integrating spatial variables related to the facies. The digital number value of the IKONOS NIR band, which is a remotely sensed image with high spatial resolution, was constructed as a spatial database that represents spectral reflectance. The distribution of the tidal channel network was extracted from the IKONOS image and the density of tidal channels was built as a spatial database. The relative weighting of two variables, i.e. IKONOS NIR band and the density of tidal channels, was determined based upon a previous study, and a group of grain-size samples was analyzed to estimate the boundaries between sedimentary facies. The classification showed a relatively high level of accuracy in terms of comparison with another group of grain-size samples. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is applicable to the mapping of surface sedimentary facies in a tidal flat based on remote sensing images with high spatial resolution. The use of sufficient control factors and a suitable model for quantitative estimates of the weighting for each factor is expected to enable precise mapping of the distribution of surface sedimentary facies in tidal flats.																	0749-0208	1551-5036					2011			2		64		1653	1657										WOS:000302825000126

Szczecin, Poland, ISSN 0749-0208 This paper proposes a remote sensing technique to monitor surf zone processes. Specifically, we assessed tidal cycle-induced surf zone evolution on the Mallipo (Korea) sand beach by associating X-band radar images and transmitted wave-buoy data, in all weather conditions. Much of the west coast of Korea is bounded by dynamic macro-tidal sand beaches considerably influenced by wave breaking processes in the surf zone. Since wave dynamics on a macro-tidal beach can be significantly influenced by rapid and large changes of water depth, X-band radar image data were used to estimate wave attenuation coefficients, monitoring of which in the surf zone throughout the tidal cycle is essential in describing beach processes. To do this, an image pixel array defined along the cross-shore transect was collected from sequential radar images to generate a cross-shore image timestack. Thereafter, the surf-zone area evolving in time was identified from the image timestack using a line detection method. The computed widths of the surf zone in the cross-shore direction were compared to incident wave heights from the transmitted wave-buoy data, thereby estimating the dissipation rate of breaking waves across the surf zone. The attenuation coefficient on the Mallipo sand beach was found by this method to be 0.58 overall, which is not considerably different from earlier observations on micro-tidal beaches.																	0749-0208	1551-5036					2011			2		64		1676	1680										WOS:000302825000131

Journal of Coastal Research, SI 64 (Proceedings of the 11th International Coastal Symposium), 1707 - 1711. Szczecin, Poland, ISSN 0749-0208 Climate change effects such as accelerated sea-level rise and increased hurricane activity threaten ecosystems such as along the Gulf of Mexico coast. Although sea-level rise is a relatively slow process that may allow more time to prepare and adapt, hurricane strikes are short-term, brief events that generate immediate as well as long-term effects on coastal ecosystems that could be devastating. An accurate assessment of the effects of hurricane strikes on the coastal ecosystems would be useful to policy development designed to mitigate impacts. This paper compares the land cover change around Weeks Bay, Alabama, USA following landfalls of Hurricanes Ivan and Katrina (September 16, 2004 and August 29, 2005). Two high-resolution IKONOS imagery dated immediately after Ivan and 15 months after Katrina were compared. A hybrid supervised and unsupervised image classification method that included all five bands in the images, plus the NDVI band, was employed to identify seven land cover classes from the two images. The results show that "fresh marsh" had the largest relative percent decrease (-52%) in acreage. "Brackish marsh" and "swamp" also had a small decrease in acreage, -9.8% and -9.6%, respectively. On the other hand, "Forest" gained 6.94%. These differential rates of loss and gain in land cover after repeated hurricane strikes can be used to evaluate the resiliency of the ecosystems. With more studies and verification, these rates can be used in future predictive modeling and for assessment of loss of ecosystem services due to hurricanes.																	0749-0208	1551-5036					2011			2		64		1707	1711										WOS:000302825000137

Journal of Coastal Research, SI 64 (Proceedings of the 11th International Coastal Symposium), 1718 - 1721. Szczecin, Poland, ISSN 0749-0208 Beach erosion and bedform change in the nearshore can be most commonly attributed to energetic breaking of waves in the surf zone among other physical facings such as winds, tides, river runoff, currents, etc. Typically, beach profile shapes develop in response to incident breaking waves. The in-situ sensors are limited in covering the entire measurement of the spatial wave transformation. In recent years, development of field survey techniques using laser has provoked various applications of 3-D laser scanners (LIDAR) to beach monitoring. Since bubbles and foam induced by wave breaking cause laser beams to be back-scattered, the Terrestrial LIDAR can also detect the beam signals reflected by breaking and broken waves in the nearshore. In this study, the Terrestrial LIDAR was used to survey height of breaking waves across the surf zone on the Mallipo Beach, in the west coast of Korea. In addition, the measurements by the Terrestrial LIDAR were compared with optical records of sea surface oscillations along a vertical staff. The spatial resolution was set to approximately 2 cm at a distance of 100 m from the LIDAR location installed foreshore. The sampling time interval was 0.33 s. As a result, crest elevations of 26 waves incoming in the surf zone were indentified by the Terrestrial LIDAR. Meanwhile, the concurrently recorded optical data showed that only 24 breaking waves passed by the staff. The difference is explained that two of the LIDAR-detected wave crests didn't break but propagated under foam produced by the precedent breaking wave. The variation of the elevation of the breaking wave crests across the surf zone detected by the Terrestrial LIDAR can be further used to investigate the characteristics of coastal processes.																	0749-0208	1551-5036					2011			2		64		1718	1721										WOS:000302825000139

Journal of Coastal Research, SI 64 (Proceedings of the 11th International Coastal Symposium), 1750 - 1754. Szczecin, Poland, ISSN 0749-0208 A regional algorithm has been developed for estimating total suspended matter (TSM) concentration over the MODIS time period in the French Guiana coastal waters. The temporal analysis of the 8-year time series (2002-2010) shows very different patterns of temporal variability translating the influence of the various hydrodynamic forcings occurring in this coastal system. Hydrodynamical rings formation associated with the retroflecting North Brazil current system induce strong irregular variations in the TSM loads offshore the Guiana coast. Further, strong significant 8-year interannual changes have been detected along the nearshore waters of French Guiana. The alternance in the distribution of the areas showing increasing and decreasing trends might underline the migration of mud banks particularly dynamic in this coastal region.

Derived from remote sensing data and validated by three field surveys, it has been compiled in order to understand the past and recent evolution of the area with particular reference to sea-level oscillation studies, for which this map is the basic tool. The very low human impact and rates of dynamic landscape change allow the preservation of extensive palaeo deposits and landforms, including those indicative of sea-level variations. The relative change of sea level dominates landscape evolution, allowing the formation of widespread marine and lagoon deposits often interfingering with fluvial deposits and reworked by aeolian process in the framework of consequent beach progradation.

Environmental and Anthropogenic Indicators for Coastal Risk Assessment at Massaguacu Beach (SP) Brazil	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH					11th International Coastal Symposium (ICS)	MAY 09-13, 2011	Szczecin, POLAND	Univ Szczecin, Inst Marine & Coastal Sci, Coastal Educ & Res Fdn, Univ Szczecinski (US), Cztowiek Nauka Srodowisko (CNS), ZMGM, Reg Dyrekcja Ochrony Srodowiska, Esri, Springer, Lotos, GA2 Syst, World Sci, Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht, Nfosigm, Urzad Marszalkowski Wojewodztwa Zachodniopomorskiego, Wojewodzki Fundusz Ochrony Srodowiska I Gospodarki Wodnej W Gdansku				Sousa, P. H. G. O.; Siegle, E. and Tessler, M. G., 2011. Environmental and Anthropogenic Indicators for Coastal Risk Assessment at Massaguacti Beach (SP) Brazil, SI 64 (Proceedings of the 11th International Coastal Symposium), 319 - 323. Szczecin, Poland, ISSN 0749-0208 As a widespread trend, coastal erosion is occurring on many countries around the world. In general, such process is translated in environmental and socioeconomic damages in many coastal cities. The aim of this work is to use environmental and anthropogenic indicators to manage natural resources and subsidize regional planning. The study site is Massaguacu Beach in Caraguatatuba, Northern Coast of Sao Paulo State, Brazil. The beach has been divided into three sectors and classified according to its risk in low, moderate and high. The indicators are beach profile, shoreline position, dune field, offshore settings, presence of rivers and/or inlets, terrain elevation, vegetation, coastal engineering structures, occupation rate and soil permeability. General information on these variables were extracted through remote sensing and geoprocessing techniques. The three beach sectors present different alongshore length, but a constant cross-shore distance of 500 m landwards from the water line. Sector 1, the southern part of the beach, is marked by the presence of the Massaguacu River; sector 2, central part, concentrates the urban settlement; and sector 3, in the north, comprehends the Bracui River and the landforms restricts the occupation in this area. Sectors 1 and 3 were classified as being of moderate risk, while sector 2 as being of high risk. Although the occupation rate is not too high, it has limited the beach profile and sediment budget. Any interventions in Massaguacu should consider the sediment budget behavior and erosive trends.

Mangrove Forests Submitted to Depositional Processes and Salinity Variation Investigated using satellite images and vegetation structure surveys	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH					11th International Coastal Symposium (ICS)	MAY 09-13, 2011	Szczecin, POLAND	Univ Szczecin, Inst Marine & Coastal Sci, Coastal Educ & Res Fdn, Univ Szczecinski (US), Cztowiek Nauka Srodowisko (CNS), ZMGM, Reg Dyrekcja Ochrony Srodowiska, Esri, Springer, Lotos, GA2 Syst, World Sci, Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht, Nfosigm, Urzad Marszalkowski Wojewodztwa Zachodniopomorskiego, Wojewodzki Fundusz Ochrony Srodowiska I Gospodarki Wodnej W Gdansku				Cunha-Lignon, M., Kampel, M., Menghini, R.P., Schaeffer-Novelli, Y., Cintron, G. and Dandouh-Guebas, F. 2011.

Journal of Coastal Research, SI 64 (Proceedings of the 11th International Coastal Symposium), 344 - 348. Szczecin, Poland, ISSN 0749-0208. The current paper examines the growth and spatio-temporal variation of mangrove forests in response to depositional processes and different salinity conditions. Data from mangrove vegetation structure collected at permanent plots and satellite images were used. In the northern sector important environmental changes occurred due to an artificial channel producing modifications in salinity. The southern sector is considered the best conserved mangrove area along the coast of Sao Paulo State, Brazil. Landsat TM5 images from 1997 and 2010 were processed using Geographical Information Systems. Supervised classifications complemented by visual interpretations and ground truth were used to map mangrove areas in both periods. In each permanent plot, all plants were identified and tree diameter, height, and incidence of associated species were recorded. Mean height, basal area dominance, and stem density were also assessed. In the southern sector of the study area, digital image analysis revealed shoreline progradation and mangrove establishment. These sites have demonstrated both vegetation growth and extension. In the northern sector, the satellite image analysis revealed an increase of depositional areas. An important number of associated freshwater plants were observed, inhibiting the establishment of mangrove seedlings or growth of saplings. Despite the high sedimentation rate, which enables mangrove colonization, the low salinity exerts indirect negative influence on mangrove development, considering that it creates good conditions to macrophytes reproduction. Coastal planning requires that the spatial differences be recognized as unique sub-systems due to the hydrodynamic complexity. Both on-the-ground monitoring of the vegetation structure and space-borne remote sensing are important tools to support coastal zone management.

Macro scale morphodynamics of the German North Sea coast	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH					11th International Coastal Symposium (ICS)	MAY 09-13, 2011	Szczecin, POLAND	Univ Szczecin, Inst Marine & Coastal Sci, Coastal Educ & Res Fdn, Univ Szczecinski (US), Cztowiek Nauka Srodowisko (CNS), ZMGM, Reg Dyrekcja Ochrony Srodowiska, Esri, Springer, Lotos, GA2 Syst, World Sci, Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht, Nfosigm, Urzad Marszalkowski Wojewodztwa Zachodniopomorskiego, Wojewodzki Fundusz Ochrony Srodowiska I Gospodarki Wodnej W Gdansku				The understanding of coastal rnorphodynamics is crucial to evaluate current and predict future sea bed evolution under natural forcing and anthropogenic influence. The analysis of coastal evolution commonly is based on bathymetric field data, remote sensing products, or modelling approaches. The study of macro scale morphodynamics is complicated because of the often limited amount of consistent and synoptic data, the handling of very large data-sets, and the difficult visualisation of morphological evolution. The four dimensional nature of morphological changes leads to inevitable reduction of data if different morphological stages shall be compared. Here the macro scale (decades) morphological evolution along the German North Sea coast is shown by the lateral distribution of the bed elevation range. This parameter is calculated from a large database of echo soundings carried out by the relevant German authorities for different coastal regions. The compiled data shows the highest morphological activity in the outer estuary tidal channels of the East Frisian coast and along the German West coast. Considering the known distribution of tidal currents and wave energy along the German Bight coastline, it is suggested that the main morphodynamic drivers along the East Frisian coast are the tidal currents, whereas the high morphologic activity along the West coast also can be related to wave forcing.

J	Espindola, F; Yanez, E; Barbieri, MA				Espindola, Fernando; Yanez, Eleuterio; Angela Barbieri, Maria			El Nino Southern Oscillation and spatial-temporal variability of the nominal performances of swordfish (Xiphias gladius) in the southeastern Pacific	REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA MARINA Y OCEANOGRAFIA												Swordfish (Xiphias gladius) is a highly migratory pelagic species, found in tropical, subtropical and temperate regions. In the Pacific Ocean, several studies have linked their wide latitudinal distribution (50 degrees N-50 degrees S) to environmental variables, since food is abundant along the frontal zones where currents or water bodies converge. In the southeastern Pacific, the subtropical anticyclone positively forces ocean temperatures along the west coast of South America, decreasing pole ward from the subtropical latitudes due to the El Nino Southern Oscillation. Environmental data from remote sensing enabled us to study changes in the spatial position of the 18 degrees C isotherm in relation to spatial-temporal changes in swordfish nominal fishing yields (CPUE) of industrial longline fleet in the coast of Chile. Correlations were obtained between the latitudinal gravity center (LGC) of CPUE and the latitudinal position of the 18 degrees C isotherm, between the latitudinal position of the 18 degrees C isotherm and the area bounded by the 17 degrees C isotherm, as well as between El Nino 12 index and the latitudinal position of the 18 degrees C isotherm. At a seasonal level, the 18 degrees C isotherm moves south of 37 degrees S at the beginning of the year, reaching 25 degrees S in August. This pattern occurs in a similar way to the area bounded by the 17 degrees and 18 degrees C isotherm. Two phases were observed in the swordfish CPUE, with 0.65 +/- 0.06 kg per hook since mid-April to early June, and 0.37 +/- 0.05 kg per hook from early September until late November.

CREATING POTENTIAL EROSION RISK MAP OF THE KARABURUN PENINSULA BY GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SYSTEM AND REMOTE SENSING TECHNIQUE	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY												With this study, it is aimed to draw a potential erosion risk map needed to be used for planning the precautions against erosion, which is one of the biggest problems of our country, by using advanced techniques. An area of 1126 km(2) including the Cesme Karaburun Peninsula, which is located on the west coast of Turkey, has been selected as study area. RUSLE soil loss factors have been used in the study. Each factor used for detecting the soil loss has been determined geographically from different sources and recorded as layer in database according to Geographic Information System. In the study, for determining the C factor a 15-m spatial resolution ASTER image, for determining 'L' and 'S' factors numerical counter lines, for determining 'R' factor weather observation results, and for determining 'K.' factor, soil order maps have been used. Afterwards, layers are united by using spatial intersection and new polygons containing all attributes have been created. After the database was created, the Rusle model has been applied and as a result soil loss has been determined for each polygon. At the end of the study, it has been determined that the soil loss in the Cesme Karaburun Peninsula, selected as study area, amounts to 1 279 548 t/ha/year.

Geoinformatics in mangrove monitoring: damage and recovery after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami in Phang Nga, Thailand	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												In the aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami, it has been proven that mangrove ecosystems provide protection against coastal disasters by acting as bioshields. Satellite data have been effectively used to detect, assess, and monitor the changes in mangroves during the pre- and post-tsunami periods. However, not much information regarding mangrove restoration or reforestation is available. Rather than undertaking time-consuming fieldwork, this study proposed using geoinformatic technologies such as Remote Sensing (RS), Geographic Information System (GIS), and Global Positioning System (GPS) to monitor the mangrove recovery. The analysis focused only on the tsunami-impacted mangrove areas along the western coast of the Tai Muang, Takuapa and Khuraburi Districts of Phang Nga Province, southern region of Thailand. The results consisted of 2 parts, first: the supervised classification of main land uses, namely forest, mangrove, agricultural land, built-up area, bare soil, water body, and miscellaneous covers in ASTER images, was conducted using the maximum likelihood method with higher than 75% for overall accuracy. Once the confusion between classes was improved in post-processing, the accuracy of mangrove class was greater than 85% for all dates. The results showed that the mangrove area in 2005 was reduced by approximately 5% (1054.5 ha) from 2003 due to the impact of the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami. Although the recovery program (replacing the same species of dead mangrove trees, mainly the Rhizophora apiculata Bl and Rhizophora mucronata Poir, in situ) had started by mid-2005, the areas gradually decreased to approximately 7-8% in 2006 and 2010 compared with the reference year of 2003. Second, the recovery trend was observed in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) fluctuation curve and the supporting field survey data. The recovery patterns were summarized into 2 categories: (i) gradually recovery, and (ii) fluctuating recovery. The gradually recovery category that implied the homogeneous pattern or uniform reforestation was observed in the seriously damaged area where most of the mangrove trees were swept away during the tsunami. This pattern covered approximately 50.35% of the total reforested area. The NDVI time series of the uniform or homogeneous reforested mangrove at the sampled plots has gradually increased after 2005. The fluctuating recovery category that implied the heterogeneous pattern or non-uniform reforestation was observed in partially damaged areas where some of the mangrove trees were swept away and broken but still some trees were remained in the area. The heterogeneous patterns covered approximately 49.65% of the total reforested area.

The fluorescence peak moves to longer wavelengths with the increase of chlorophyll a concentration. In this article, the fluorescence enveloped area (FEA), which integrates the fluorescence height and the fluorescence peak position, was used to estimate the chlorophyll a concentration in the coastal waters of the Pearl River Estuary. The FEA algorithm was developed from in situ data of chlorophyll a concentration, total suspended matter (TSM) concentration and above-water remote sensing reflectance, which were collected at 37 sampling stations in the Pearl River Estuary during two cruises. The results showed that the FEA algorithm made a better estimation of chlorophyll a concentration compared with the widely used FLH algorithm and moving fluorescence line height (MFLH) algorithm. These three algorithms were applied to the Pearl River Estuary for retrieval of chlorophyll a concentration from Hyperion data acquired on 21 December 2006. Compared with the FLH and the MFLH, the FEA algorithm showed a rational distribution of the chlorophyll a concentration in the Pearl River Estuary.																	0143-1161						2011	32	13					3611	3623		10.1080/01431161003762348								WOS:000293228000004

Effects of Hurricane Ike on the Louisiana-Texas coast from satellite and model data	REMOTE SENSING LETTERS												The river-influenced Mississippi-Louisiana-Texas (MsLaTex) coast in the northern Gulf of Mexico was in 2008 impacted by Hurricane Ike that made landfall along the Texas coast on 13 September 2008, causing widespread damage due to storm surge and coastal inundation. We examine the effects of the hurricane on the MsLaTex coast using remote sensing, model simulation and field observations. Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer sea surface temperature imagery indicated an approximately 2-4 degrees C decrease in temperature to the right of the hurricane track. The high-resolution (similar to 2 km) three-dimensional Navy Coastal Ocean Model simulation and tide data suggested the generation of a coastally trapped `barotropic Kelvin' wave during the passage of Ike, which may have contributed to an earlier than expected surge in sea level. A distinct elevated band of suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentration extending from Louisiana to Texas (similar to 90.5-94.5 degrees W) coast was observed offshore in sea-viewing wide field-of-view sensor-derived imagery of 17 and 25 September that appeared to be associated with the coastally trapped Kelvin wave that was enhanced west of the Mississippi Canyon. Two intermittent wind events on 15 and 21 September likely kept the SPM in suspension for an extended period. Subsequently, on 27 and 30 September, SPM decreased along the elevated band and near the landfall site but increased near the bays and passes due to receding flood waters. Off the Atchafalaya and Mississippi deltas a large pulse of river discharge containing elevated SPM levels caused a plume around the two river deltas and its offshore dispersion into the open Gulf of Mexico.

The coastal land lost and gained illustrations were derived from the extracted coastlines, the rates of coastal change were estimated, and the coastal parts that experienced the biggest changes were identified. The results illustrated that the erosion rates of the AYR Delta coast decreased during 1978-2000 while the erosion effect remained strong. The spatial-temporal changing patterns of the northern, central and southern coastal parts in the study area were characterised by slow erosion, erosion and dynamic balance of erosion/accretion.																	0957-4352	1741-5101					2011	45	4					327	341										WOS:000292422900003

Thermal infrared remote sensing of mineral dust over land and ocean: a spectral SVD based retrieval approach for IASI	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES												From the high spectral resolution thermal infrared observations of the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) mineral dust AOD (transferred from thermal infrared to 0.5 mu m) is retrieved using a Singular Vector Decomposition of brightness temperature spectra. As infrared retrieval based on 8-12 mu m observations, dust observation with IASI is independent from solar illumination. Through the linear combinations of suitable independent singular vectors weighted by their contribution to the observed signal, and a projection of different a-priori dust spectra on the resulting signal the dust can be well distinguished from the influence of surface emissivity and gas absorption. In contrast to lookup-table based single-channel retrievals this method takes advantage of the spectral shape of dust extinction and surface and atmosphere influence over the total 8-12 mu m window band. Using different a-priori spectra for dust extinction allows also for an estimation of dust particle size in terms of effective radius based on the respective dust model size distributions. These dust models are also used for the transfer of infrared AOD to 0.5 mu m. Four months of IASI observations covering Northern Africa and Arabia are used for evaluation. Two large scale dust events, one covering the Arabian Peninsula and adjacent parts of the Indian Ocean, the other over the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of West-Africa, are analysed and compared with other satellite images. They also show the good suitability of IASI data for dust observation at day and night. Monthly means derived from IASI observations represent well the known seasonal cycles of dust activity over Northern Africa and Arabia. IASI Dust AOD(0.5 mu m) and AERONET coarse mode AOD(0.5 mu m) are reasonably well (linearly) correlated with rho = 0.623. Moreover, comparison of time series of AERONET and IASI observations shows that the evolution of dust events is very well covered by the IASI observations. Rank correlation between dust effective radius and AERONET Angstrom exponent is -0.557 indicating the general capability of (qualitative) dust particle size information being provided by this method.																	1867-1381	1867-8548					2011	4	5					757	773		10.5194/amt-4-757-2011								WOS:000291090800001

Monitoring brackishwater aquaculture development using multi-spectral satellite data and GIS - a case study near Pichavaram mangroves south-east coast of India	INDIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES												Satellite data of Landsat TM, IRS 1B LISS II, IRS 1C LISS III and IRS 1D LISS III were used to monitor aquaculture development and its spatial distribution in Cuddalore District, south-east coast of India. Analysis of satellite images using image processing software ERDAS Imagine 9.0 and Geographic Information System (GIS) software Arc GIS 9.0 indicated that the area under aquaculture was 6.91 ha in 1987, gradually increasing to 67.71 ha in 1994, and reaching a maximum of 380.19 ha in 1998. There was a little shrimp culture development (6.14 ha) from 1998 to 2005 because of risk of White Spot Syndrome Virus (WSSV), epizootics and constraints related to social and environmental concerns raised against shrimp farming. Shrimp farms initially started in the marsh areas close to creeks and then moved inland towards agricultural and fallow lands. Farms developed in clusters along the creeks without affecting mangrove reserve forests between 1988 and 2005 and about 177.02 ha agriculture land including 234.25 ha fallow lands were converted for aquaculture farming. Shrimp culture was abandoned in 109.47 ha and 15.13 ha of agricultural land previously converted to aquaculture farms, was reconverted for agriculture. The present study shows that remote sensing data and GIS are useful tools in assessing and monitoring the development of aquaculture for larger areas and suggests that national level planning using multi-spectral satellite data can be used to assess the existing land use and the potential for sustainable use of coastal resources.																	0970-6011					JAN-MAR	2011	58	1					85	90										WOS:000290290100014

Remote Sensing of Chlorophyll and Sea Surface Temperature in Indian Water with Impact of 2004 Sumatra Tsunami	MARINE GEODESY												The daily and weekly averaged Indian Remote Sensing satellite IRS-P4 Ocean Color Monitor (OCM) derived chlorophyll images were generated and interpreted in terms of pretsunami, tsunami, and posttsunami periods in the Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea. There has been observation of increase in chlorophyll concentration up to 5.0 mg/m3 in the tsunami-affected coastal waters. The high chlorophyll concentration lasted for about one week after the tsunami catastrophe. The standard deviation for different transects in the tsunami-affected water were plotted. The high chlorophyll has been observed for selected transects in the aftermath of the tsunami event in coastal regions, and offshore water has also shown increase in chlorophyll concentration (1.0 mg/m3) in the Bay of Bengal. The analysis indicated that the tsunami waves might have displaced and spread the high chlorophyll coastal water towards offshore. NASA Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua daytime sea surface temperature (SST) daily images were retrieved and displayed during December 21, 2004, to January 6, 2005, and indicated the cooling (0.5-1 degrees C) in the Bay of Bengal around Tamil Nadu and Andhra coast. The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Prediction-National Center for Environment Prediction (NOAA-NCEP) data for five weeks (December 9, 2004-January 12, 2005) were retrieved to study the SST variability trend in prior to MODIS data and indicated 0.5-1 degrees C cooling of the Bay of Bengal water off Kakinada, Chennai, Cuddalore, and Nagapattinam region on December 26 and 28, 2004.																	0149-0419						2011	34	2					152	166	PII 937663504	10.1080/01490419.2011.571561								WOS:000290668300005						
J	Yang, DT; Huang, DJ				Yang Dingtian; Huang Daojian			Impacts of Typhoons Tianying and Dawei on seagrass distribution in Xincun Bay, Hainan Province, China	ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA												More than 50% of the typhoons landing in China have landed on the southeast coast, where they have caused great pressure on the coastal environment. Seagrass, one of the most important constituents of coastal ecosystems, is also greatly affected by typhoons. In order to clarify how seagrass distribution variation is affected by typhoons in coastal areas in southeast China, data of Typhoons Dawei and Tianying (category 4 and category 2 respectively, which just ran through the southern part of Hainan province) have been studied. In situ observation and satellite remote sensing data (CBERS-China Brazil Earth Resources Satellite) in 2004 and 2006 were used to retrieve seagrass distribution in Xincun Bay, Hainan province. In situ observations showed that leaf length, stem biomass and above ground biomass on average showed evidence of reduction after Typhoons Tianying and Dawei. However, seagrass density showed no evidence of reduction after typhoon Tianying and Dawei passed by and increased rapidly in January 2006. From results of satellite remote sensing data, seagrass distribution can be detected with high accuracy, and the area of seagrass distribution on the south coast of Xincun Bay in 2006 after the typhoon passed by was smaller than that in 2004 in region A and B. However, in region C, area of seagrass coverage under 20% increased. These results demonstrated that typhoons Tianying and Dawei damaged seagrass bed and helped seagrass to get rid of aged and dead leaves, and this correspondingly facilitated seagrass growth.																	0253-505X					JAN	2011	30	1					32	39		10.1007/s13131-011-0088-5								WOS:000289699600005

Unusual diurnal variation in surface ozone observed after the 26 December 2004 tsunami over the rural site of Bay of Bengal, India	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Measurements of surface ozone (O-3) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) were studied from December 2004 to February 2005, covering the giant tsunami event on 26 December 2004 at Tranquebar (11 degrees N, 79.9 degrees E, 9 m) over the west coast of the Bay of Bengal, India. An unusual maximum O-3 concentration of 28 parts per billion by volume (ppbv) was observed in the morning and a minimum (16 ppbv) in the evening, indicating that pronounced chemical loss of O-3 occurred in the daytime after the tsunami over this coastal region. An increase in NO2 concentration from 5.6 ppbv before the tsunami to 10.5 ppbv after the tsunami was observed in the daytime. The observed unusual diurnal changes in O-3 were not due to mass transport processes as the five-day back trajectories of air parcels transport before and after the tsunami remained unchanged. Similarly, meteorological and micrometeorological parameters were found to be normal before and after the tsunami. The unusual low O-3 level during the daytime was possibly due to prolonged excess emission of iodocarbons from the sea surface after the tsunami, which resulted in enhanced inorganic iodine (I-x) concentration, leading to massive destruction of O-3. Similarly, unusually high O-3 levels during the night-time were possibly due to the intrusion of ozone-rich air after the tsunami from the free troposphere into the surface layer when the boundary layer height shrinks after midnight. The present work can be extended on a regional scale by incorporating modelling studies using recent remote sensing tools.																	0143-1161	1366-5901					2011	32	4					951	971		10.1080/01431160903493806								WOS:000288065100004

Extremes in summer monsoon precipitation over India during 2001-2009 using CPC high-resolution data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												High-resolution Climate Prediction Center (CPC) merged daily precipitation estimates based on satellite and raingauge data, available for the period 2001-2009, were analysed to determine the spatiotemporal variability of various indices of precipitation extremes during the summer monsoon season of the Indian subcontinent. Evaluation of the CPC 0.1 degrees latitude x 0.1 degrees longitude resolution merged precipitation data was carried out for the monsoon season by comparison with India Meteorological Department (IMD) 1 degrees latitude x 1 degrees longitude resolution gridded data for the common period of three years (2001, 2002 and 2003). Day-to-day variation in rainfall activity over the central Indian region obtained from these data sets was highly correlated, with a correlation coefficient of 0.62 (significant at the 0.1% level). The study showed that, over most of India, the mean and extremes in rainfall are captured well by the CPC data. However, the CPC data underestimate rainfall activities over the west coast and the northeastern part of the country, where heavy rainfall activity occurs throughout the season. Over the southeastern part of the subcontinent, where rainfall activity is lower, the CPC data overestimate the number of rainy days. The spatial and temporal variation of the summer monsoon rainfall (SMR) was examined by computing various indices of precipitation extremes using CPC data for all the available years (from 2001 to 2009). The spatial pattern of the rainy days and heavy precipitation indices follows the spatial pattern of the seasonal rainfall. Large interannual variability is observed in the spatial distribution of the indices of precipitation extremes. The precipitation indices over central India show low values during drought years compared to normal years (statistically significant at the 1% level). This indicates that a monsoon drought is associated with a drastic reduction in heavy rainfall activities compared to a normal monsoon year. The study shows that remote sensing plays an important role in monitoring climate change by providing continuous datasets at high resolution and also in studying the climate of data-sparse regions.

J	Zhang, CY; Hong, HS; Ru, CM; Shang, SL				Zhang Caiyun; Hong Huasheng; Ru Chuanmin; Shang Shaoling			Evolution of a coastal upwelling event during summer 2004 in the southern Taiwan Strait	ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA												A coastal upwelling event in the southern Taiwan Strait (STWS) was investigated using intensive cruise surveys (four repeated transects in a month) and satellite data in July and early August 2004. The extensive upwelling-associated surface cold water was first observed in early July (similar to 2.0 x 10(4) km(2)) along the STWS coast. Than, the cold surface water reduced in size by similar to 50% with decreased chlorophyll concentrations after 15 days, indicating the weakening of the upwelling event. At the end of July, the cold surface water disappeared. The temporal variations of the surface cold water and the 3-D hydrography around Dongshan Island are thought to be mainly attributed to the weakened upwelling-favorable southwestern wind, the asymmetric spatial structure of the wind field and the intrusion of warm water from the northern South China Sea.

Prominent changes have been observed during the past 30 years through land use/land cover analyzes which clearly indicate that the coastal regulatory zones have altered in respect of both natural and anthropogenic activities. Various geomorphic units were identified and confirmed with appropriate field work. Significant changes have been recognized in the shoreline map, which denote that the area of erosional shoreline is larger than the accretional and stable prone shoreline. The availability of high resolution data has helped to prepare large-scale maps for implementation of CRZ measures. The results were promising and suggest that the modern geo-spatial information and technological tools are extremely helpful for conducting coastal morphological studies.					rao, nageswara/0000-0001-5963-097X; Pisupati, Dr. Swarna Latha/0000-0002-0811-2520												1010-6049						2011	26	5					391	411		10.1080/10106049.2011.586733								WOS:000208631500005

Woody vegetative cover dynamics in response to recent climate change on an Atlantic coast barrier island: a remote sensing approach	GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL												Considering impacts of predicted increases in sea-level, storms, and alterations in precipitation patterns on geomorphological and associated ecological processes, woody vegetation dynamics may serve as sentinels to climate change on barrier islands. We examined island-scale conversion of land (i.e. sand to grassland to woody cover) while relating the importance of climate variables on rate of woody expansion. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) was used to evaluate potential distribution of woody species based on distance to shoreline and elevation. Using Landsat TM imagery, we monitored changes in island size and vegetation classes (1984-2010). These comparisons revealed conversion of grassland to woody cover (285% increase) was closely linked to air temperature, precipitation and atmospheric [CO2]. LiDAR data indicated that woody species have not expanded completely into the potential range. Our results suggest that woody species are responsive to climate change, thus serving as sentinels on Virginia barrier islands.																	1010-6049						2011	26	8			SI		595	612		10.1080/10106049.2011.621031								WOS:000208631900002

Using remote sensing and imagery exploitation to monitor the dynamics of East Timbalier Island, LA: 2000-2010	GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL												In 1999, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-National Marine Fisheries Service and the State of Louisiana jointly undertook the restoration of East Timbalier, a barrier island along a sediment-starved portion of the Gulf of Mexico coast of Louisiana. High-resolution overhead imagery was used to monitor the course of this restoration effort. This article describes the changes in area and movement of East Timbalier Island and compares these changes with the previous measurements. Between 2000 and 2010, East Timbalier Island lost 52-66% of its area and moved northwards 12-105 m/year. The area of East Timbalier Island is less today than at any time since 1887. Understanding of the physical processes in nature that control the size, shape and movement of the island, as well as the human impacts that have hastened its degradation, is critical for accomplishing any future restoration.																	1010-6049						2011	26	8			SI		613	632		10.1080/10106049.2011.623791								WOS:000208631900003

Analysis of the resulting three-year database shows that, in general, the wind products from both sensors have characteristics similar to those reported in the literature. Then, we perform an error analysis in the space domain and find that there is significant discrepancy between the two wind products as the matchup points move closer to the coast. The root-mean-square error (rmse) and standard deviation (STD) between the two data sets increases markedly for points matched within about 100 km of the coastline. Beyond 100 km, the rmse, STD, and systematic bias become small and stable. In addition, an empirical relationship between QuikSCAT and SAR winds in coastal region is proposed. Thus, the bias and errors should be taken into account if the standard operational QuikSCAT wind products are used for forcing models in the coastal ocean.				yang, xiaofeng/K-5245-2015; Li, Xiaofeng/B-6524-2008; Pichel, William/F-5619-2010	yang, xiaofeng/0000-0001-9920-4641; Li, Xiaofeng/0000-0001-7038-5119; Pichel, William/0000-0001-6332-0149												1545-598X					JAN	2011	8	1					163	167		10.1109/LGRS.2010.2053345								WOS:000285844000034

The present study was conducted to assess the mangrove vegetation at Tumpat based on ground-truth and remote sensing measurements. The mangroves are composed of several species including Nypa fruticans, Sonneratia caseolaris, Avicennia alba, Rhizophora apiculata, R. mucronata and Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, in order of dominance. The point-centred quarter method (PCQM) was used to estimate the stem density (number of stems/0.1 ha) and basal area (m(2)/0.1 ha) at selected sites on the ground. Recent high-resolution multispectral satellite data (QuickBird 2006, 2.4 m spatial resolution of the multispectral image) were used to produce land-use/cover classification and Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI) mapping for the delta. The area statistics reveal that mangroves occupy 339.6 ha, while coconut plantation dominates the vegetation (715.2 ha), followed by settlements (621.6 ha), sandbar (148.4 ha), agriculture (89 ha) and aquaculture (42.7 ha). Although the relationship between the spectral indices and dendrometric parameters was weak, we found a very high significance between the (mean) NDVI and stem density (p - 1.3 x 10(-8)). The sites with young/growing and also mature trees with lush green cover showed greater NDVI values (0.40-0.68) indicating healthy vegetation, while mature forests under environmental stress due to sand deposition and/or poor tidal inundation showed low NDVI values (0.38-0.47) and an unhealthy situation. Overall, a combination of ground survey and remote sensing provided valuable information for the assessment of mangrove vegetation types (i.e. young/growing or mature forest) and their health in Tumpat, Kelantan Delta.

J	Rao, G; Lin, AM				Rao, Gang; Lin, Aiming			Distribution of inundation by the great tsunami of the 2011 M-w 9.0 earthquake off the Pacific coast of Tohoku (Japan), as revealed by ALOS imagery data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The 2011 M-w 9.0 earthquake off the Pacific coast of Tohoku (Japan) generated a great tsunami that inundated a wide area of the east coast of northeast Japan. In this study, we identify the distribution of tsunami inundation along a 340 km-long section of coast in northeast Honshu Island, based mainly on Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) imagery data and with cross-checking by aerial photographs and Google Earth images acquired before and after the 2011 earthquake. The analyses of remote-sensing imagery data, combined with fieldwork observations, show that (i) inundation by the tsunami extended over a wide area with a large inland limit of inundation, up to similar to 5.5 km from the coast in low-lying areas and up to similar to 15 km in a narrow bay area at the mouth of a large river; and (ii) high run-ups of up to similar to 35 m occurred in areas with a sawtooth coastline close to the epicentre of the 2011 main shock. The results demonstrate that remote-sensing techniques provide a powerful tool for rapidly identifying the distribution of tsunami inundation caused by the 2011 great earthquake, especially in remote and rugged coastal areas, and in areas threatened by nuclear radiation leaking from the nuclear power plant at Fukushima.

J	Ohde, T; Mohrholz, V				Ohde, Thomas; Mohrholz, Volker			Interannual variability of sulphur plumes off the Namibian coast	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Coastal sulphur plumes in the upper water layer are frequently observed off the Namibian coast. However, their temporal and spatial development, strength, size and impact on marine life differ at a wide range. This study compares the events of years 2007/2008 to the years 2004/2005 along the Namibian coast, including regional features on the basis of remote sensing satellite data, in situ measurements of a mooring and local observations. The remotely sensed derived intensity of coastal sulphur plumes of year 2008 was very weak compared to 2004 and especially to 2005, the year with the highest activity during the study period. In 2008, the overall maximum of sulphur plumes was observed in February, about 2 months earlier than in 2004 and 2005 when highest intensity was detected in April. Locally, differences in timing and strength of sulphur plumes occurred in the area of the Walvis Bay. There, the maximum intensity was observed in March 2004 and in April 2005, but in 2008 no clear maximum was found. The remotely sensed identified coastal sulphur plumes correlate with periods of low oxygen concentrations in bottom water and high fraction of South Atlantic central water (SACW) at a mooring 20 nautical miles off the central Namibian coast. An exception is the area in the vicinity of the Walvis Bay lagoon that seems to be driven by different local dynamics. The total variability of the sulphur plumes could not be explained by the observed oceanographic conditions alone. Additionally, microbiological and chemical processes in the sediment and the bottom water layer should be included in future investigations related to annual and interannual variability. Disastrous local events were observed in the year 2008 although the averaged intensity was low compared to the years 2004/2005. Therefore, the remotely sensed derived averaged intensity gives probably no real impression of the local impact of sulphur plumes on marine life. A combination of all available methods like the detection by local observations, in situ measurements and remote sensing approaches is required.

Dynamic land use and land cover changes and their effect on forest resources in a coastal village of Matemwe, Zanzibar, Tanzania	LAND USE POLICY												Recent land cover change estimates show overall decline of tropical forests at the regional and global scales caused by multiple social, cultural and economic factors. There is an overall concern on the prevailing land use practices, such as shifting cultivation and extraction of forest materials as agents of forests losses, but also new, emerging land uses are threatening tropical forests. Understanding of the long-term development and driving forces of forest changes are needed, especially at local levels where many decisions on forest policies and land uses are made. This paper addresses the importance of such information for improved estimates of forest dynamics by studying local level land cover and land use changes during the last 50-70 years in the Eastern African tropical island of Zanzibar, Tanzania. The paper discusses the role of traditional and new land uses mainly subsistence farming, tourism and government interference through tree planting, in the long-term development of the forests at the village level. The material for the study is gathered from the interpretation of archival maps and aerial photographs combined with contemporary digital aerial photographs. The analyses are based on the mapping, spatial sampling and spatio-temporal change trajectory analysis (LCTA) of forest land cover, forest land uses and settlement patterns with GIS and statistics. Six distinct forest land cover change trajectories were identified and these illustrate dynamic and heterogeneous nature of the forests. Closed forest cover has dominated throughout due to cyclical land use patterns, but over 70% of the land area has been continuously transforming between closed, semi-open and open land cover conditions. Land use turnover rates indicate that hardly any forest areas are left untouched from the forces, which remove and re-establish forest vegetation in the long run. Land cover and land use change trajectories are spatially fragmented in the studied landscape. Majority of forest loss-gain dynamics is caused by shifting cultivation, while forest losses are most dramatic along the coast, where traditional and new land uses meet and land uses pressures are highest. The study suggests that landscape change trajectory analyses, where contemporary and historical information on land uses and land cover changes are spatially linked, can provide valuable aspects into local level forest land use planning and management strategies. For the case study, the findings suggest the following key forest management strategies for consideration: (1) establishment of a protected forest/scrubland in participation with the local stakeholders, especially the farmers. (2) promotion of areas for permanent agricultural practices, while simultaneously introducing management controls in the traditional slash-and-burn farming areas, and (3) promoting new livelihood opportunities for the farmers, who have traditionally been dependent on forest resources, meanwhile introducing alternatives for fuel wood for cooking.

Rocky intertidal temperature variability along the southeast coast of Australia: comparing data from in situ loggers, satellite-derived SST and terrestrial weather stations	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Predicting how both spatial and temporal variation in sea and air temperature influence the distribution of intertidal organisms is a pressing issue. We used data from satellites, weather stations and in situ loggers to test the hypothesis that satellite-derived sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and weather station air temperatures provide accurate estimates of ambient temperature variability on rocky intertidal shores for temporal (hourly for 1 yr) and spatial (10 m to 400 km) variation along the southeast coast of Australia. We also tested whether satellites and weather stations accurately detect the duration, frequency and number of extreme temperature events. Daily mean satellite SSTs and weather station air temperatures were significantly and strongly correlated with intertidal water and air temperatures, respectively (water: r(2) = 0.62, air: r(2) = 0.63). Nevertheless, depending on location, daily satellite SSTs were up to 6.7 degrees C, and on average 1 degrees C, higher than in situ water temperatures, while daily maximum air temperatures measured by weather stations were up to 23.2 degrees C, and on average 4.2 degrees C, lower than in situ air temperatures. At all locations, the frequency, duration and number of days greater than 30 degrees C, as well as rates of temperature change, were all significantly lower when measured by weather stations. These differences suggest that satellite SSTs and weather stations are ineffective at capturing extremes in intertidal water and air temperature variability. We reinforce the argument that in situ measurements that focus on biologically relevant variation are the only legitimate means of predicting the effects of temperature change on intertidal taxa.

We employ this system to study the Lebanese oil-pollution crisis in summer 2006 and thus to assist regional and local decision makers in Europe, regionally and locally. The MEDSLIK oil-spill predictions obtained using CYCOFOS high-resolution ocean fields are compared with those obtained using lower-resolution MFS hydrodynamics, and both are validated against satellite observations. The predicted beached oil distributions along the Lebanese and Syrian coasts are compared with in situ observations. The oil-spill predictions are able to simulate the northward movement of the oil spill, with the CYCOFOS predictions being in better agreement with satellite observations.

As an important branch of remote sensing, satellite based synthetic aperture radar imagery (SAR) is the most effective way to accomplish these tasks. Since a marine surface with oil spill seems as a dark object because of much lower backscattered energy, the main problem is to recognize and differentiate the dark objects of oil spills from others to be formed by oceanographic and atmospheric conditions. In this study, Radarsat-1 images covering Lebanese coasts were employed for oil spill detection. For this purpose, a powerful classifier, Artificial Neural Network Multilayer Perceptron (ANN MLP) was used. As the original contribution of the paper, the network was trained by a novel heuristic optimization algorithm known as Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) method besides the conventional Backpropagation (BP) and Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) learning algorithms. A comparison and evaluation of different network training algorithms regarding reliability of detection and robustness show that for this problem best result is achieved with the Artificial Bee Colony algorithm (ABC).

Generation of high-resolution East Antarctic landfast sea-ice maps from cloud-free MODIS satellite composite imagery	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												A method to generate high spatio-temporal resolution maps of landfast sea ice from cloud-free MODIS composite imagery is presented. Visible (summertime) and thermal infrared (wintertime) cloud-free 20-day MODIS composite images are used as the basis for these maps, augmented by AMSR-E ASI sea-ice concentration composite images (when MODIS composite image quality is insufficient). The success of this technique is dependent upon efficient cloud removal during the compositing process. Example wintertime maximum (-374,000 km(2)) and summertime minimum (similar to 112,000 km(2)) fast-ice maps for the entire East Antarctic coast are presented. The summertime minimum map provides the first high-resolution indication of multi-year fast-ice extent, which may be used to help assess changes in Antarctic sea-ice volume. The 2 sigma errors in fast-ice extent are estimated to be +/- 2.98% when >= 90% of the fast-ice pixels in a 20-day period are classified using the MODIS composite, or +/-8.76 otherwise (when augmenting AMSR-E or the previous/next MODIS composite image is used to classify >10% of the fast ice). Imperfect composite image quality, caused by persistent cloud, inaccurate cloud masking or a highly dynamic fast-ice edge, was the biggest impediment to automating the fast-ice detection procedure.

Multi-Scale Sensor Fusion With an Online Application: Integrating GOES, MODIS, and Webcam Imagery for Environmental Monitoring	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING												Webcam and satellite imagery are integral sensor web components, but there are few websites that directly synthesize these products. Additionally, websites as a means for reviewing multiple images in an organized way and for analyzing time-series imagery have not been fully explored. This paper describes howweb applications can facilitate review of image archives for multi-scale sensor data fusion, with a test case of an automatic panning camera at the highest peak on Santa Cruz Island (in Channel Islands National Park off the Santa Barbara, CA coast) and MODIS and GOES-11 satellite imagery. We developed the application PanOpt (http://zulu.geog.ucsb.edu/panopt/index.html) for filtering this image database and outputting selected images as a static matrix or as an animation. On-demand product generation includes time-series charts and scatter plots of image metrics for regions of interest, with data markers linked to views of corresponding satellite and camera imagery via event-based web scripting. This is useful not only for exploratory analysis but is well suited for pedagogical applications and imparting a greater synoptic understanding of environmental phenomena. Demonstration of this website's utility includes multi-modal characterization of clouds as well as ground-and satellite-based plant phenology time-series. With this tool, the quantitative and qualitative aspects of image exploration are synergistic, making it easier to discern underlying trends and anomalies and to identify directions for further analysis.																	1939-1404	2151-1535				DEC	2010	3	4	1				497	506		10.1109/JSTARS.2010.2048419								WOS:000285358700011						
J	Durden, SL				Durden, Stephen L.			Remote Sensing and Modeling of Cyclone Monica near Peak Intensity	ATMOSPHERE												Cyclone Monica was an intense Southern Hemisphere tropical cyclone of 2006. Although no in situ measurements of Monica's inner core were made, microwave, infrared, and visible satellite instruments observed Monica before and during peak intensity through landfall on Australia's northern coast. The author analyzes remote sensing measurements in detail to investigate Monica's intensity. While Dvorak analysis of its imagery argues that it was of extreme intensity, infrared and microwave soundings indicate a somewhat lower intensity, especially as it neared landfall. The author also describes several numerical model runs that were made to investigate the maximum possible intensity for the observed environmental conditions; these simulations also suggest a lower intensity than estimates from Dvorak analysis alone. Based on the evidence from the various measurements and modeling, the estimated range for the minimum sea level pressure at peak intensity is 900 to 920 hPa. The estimated range for the one-minute averaged maximum wind speed at peak intensity is 72 to 82 m/s. These maxima were likely reached about 24 hours prior to landfall, with some weakening occurring afterward.																	2073-4433					DEC	2010	1	1					15	33		10.3390/atmos1010015								WOS:000208732000003

Some of these landslides induced large tsunami waves within the fjord causing fatalities and damaging several salmon farms, the most important economic activity of the area. The landslides included rock slides and avalanches, rock falls, shallow soil and soil-rock slides, and debris flows. The earthquake was the climax of a seismic swarm that began 3 months earlier. The seismicity is associated with tectonic activity along the Liquie-Ofqui fault zone (LOFZ), a major structural feature of the region. The earthquake-induced landslides were mapped and classified from field observations and remote sensing analysis. The landslide areas and epicentral distances are within the expected range for the earthquake magnitude according to worldwide data, while the position of landslides on the slopes strongly suggests topographic amplification effects in triggering the failures. The location of the landslides is also clearly related to some of the main fault branches of the LOFZ. The seismic event has configured a new situation of seismic and landslide hazard in the Ays,n region and along the LOFZ, where the presence of towns and economic infrastructure along the coasts of several fjords constitutes a potential risk that was not considered before this seismic event.

Remote Sensing of Turbidity and Phosphate in Creeks and Coast of Mumbai: An Effect of Organic Matter	TRANSACTIONS IN GIS												Geospatial approaches to monitoring and mapping water quality over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales have the potential to save field and laboratory efforts. The present study depicts the estimation of water quality parameters, namely turbidity and phosphate, through regression analysis using the reflectance derived from remote sensing data on the west coast of Mumbai, India. The predetermined coastal water samples were collected using the global positioning system (GPS) and were measured concurrently with satellite imagery acquisition. To study the influence of wastewater, the linear correlations were established between water quality parameters and reflectance of visible bands for either set of imagery for the study area, which was divided into three zones: creek water, shore-line water and coastal water. Turbidity and phosphate have the correlation coefficients in the range 0.75-0.94 and 0.78-0.98, respectively, for the study area. Negative correlation was observed for creek water owing to high organic content caused by the discharges of domestic wastewater from treatment facilities and non-point sources. Based on the least square method, equations are formulated to estimate turbidity and phosphate, to map the spatial variation on the GIS platform from simulated points. The applicability of satellite imagery for water quality pattern on the coast is verified for efficient planning and management.																	1361-1682					DEC	2010	14	6					811	832		10.1111/j.1467-9671.2010.01234.x								WOS:000292197300006

The Jawili mangroves, absent from current maps, actually included 21.5 ha with 24 true mangrove species. On the other hand, the Batan Estuary mangroves, shown to be 4244 ha in available topographic maps, revealed only 406 ha of scattered patches. Actual mangrove data on specific areas worldwide is limited, especially in the Philippines where available maps show discrepancies from actual mangrove distribution. Remote sensing (RS) techniques provide promising results but require expensive setup, particularly for small areas. Therefore, financially limited users need affordable and rapid mapping alternatives. The practical techniques presented here can be immediately implemented at minimal cost and can produce useful estimates of actual mangrove area, fundamental for coastal management. Basic principles used here also have potential applications in other systems and locations. When resources are available though, additional confirmation and precise mapping are also further recommended.

In this study, field measurements were applied to develop ocean color satellite algorithms of phytoplankton pigments from in-water radiometry measurements. The match-up comparisons showed that the satellite-derived pigments from our algorithms agree reasonably well (e.g. 30-55% of uncertainty for SeaWiFS and 37-50% for MODIS-Aqua) to field data, with better agreement (e.g. 30-38% of uncertainty for SeaWiFS and 39-44% for MODIS-Aqua) for pigments abundant in diatoms. The seasonal and spatial variations of satellite-derived phytoplankton biomarker pigments, such as fucoxanthin, which is abundant in diatoms, peridinin, which is found only in peridinin-containing dinoflagellates, and zeaxanthin, which is primarily from cyanobacteria in coastal waters, revealed that higher densities of diatoms are more likely to occur on the inner shelf and during winter-spring and obscure other abundant phytoplankton groups. However, relatively higher densities of other phytoplankton, such as dinoflagellates and cyanobacteria, are likely to occur on the mid- to outer-continental shelf and during summer. Seasonal variation of riverine discharge may play an important role in stimulating algal blooms, in particular diatoms, while higher abundances of cyanobacteria coincide with warmer water temperatures and lower nutrient concentrations.

J	Lichter, M; Zviely, D; Klein, M				Lichter, Michal; Zviely, Dov; Klein, Micha			Morphological patterns of southeastern Mediterranean river mouths: The topographic setting of the beach as a forcing factor	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Israeli Mediterranean river mouths are characterized by an extremely dynamic morphology, as their channels tend to migrate hundreds of meters north and south along the shoreline. This study aims to characterize the impact of the topographic setting of the beach on the dynamic morphology of seven of these river mouths. This was achieved by morphologically mapping and monitoring the natural channel dynamics of each mouth over time; recognizing their spatial and temporal migration and avulsion patterns; describing, generalizing and classifying the different types of river mouths present on the coast; and investigating the influence of the adjacent topography on their morphology. Detailed geomorphologic mapping was achieved using remote sensing and GIS techniques, utilizing more than 300 aerial photographs taken between 1918 and 2005. This study revealed a number of typical differences in these patterns, attributed to differences in the topographic setting of the beach in the vicinity of the mouths. "Elongated strip" topography coasts demonstrate a uniform slope beach with equally spaced elevation contours, forming a narrow sandy strip between the shoreline and the back-berm. "Funnel" topography coasts exhibit a non-uniform slope with a funnel-shaped topographic depression adjacent to the river mouth. Similarities were found between the spatial and the temporal morphological patterns of river mouths flowing in each of these two topographical settings. Elongated strip mouths are deflected alongshore a barrier and demonstrate high migration distances and little temporal change. The morphology of funnel mouths was found to be highly temporally variable yet less spatially dynamic, as these mouths' channels are restricted by their funnel topography. This study concludes that the topographic setting of the beach, a constant element in the temporal scale of this study, is a primary factor influencing the morphology of the studied mouths.

Ecotourism Impacts in the Nicoya Peninsula, Costa Rica	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TOURISM RESEARCH												Ecotourism promotes responsible travel to natural areas, environmental conservation and the well-being of local communities. Eco-lodges are an important component of ecotourism ventures but an infrequently researched component of this field. Considering their influence on the natural environment (design and operation) and local communities (employment practices and purchases), the success of ecotourism depends, in part, on the performance of eco-lodges. This project studies the effects of the Punta Islita (PI) eco-lodge on the Nicoya Peninsula, Costa Rica. An interdisciplinary nested-scale analysis, combining guest and household interviews with multi-temporal remote sensing analysis of forest cover change of the lodge and surrounding areas, is used to evaluate the environmental, economic and social impacts of ecotourism in the region. Our results show significant positive contributions of the PI eco-lodge on forest cover, environmental conservation, and local economic incomes within the surrounding communities. For local livelihoods, the PI eco-lodge was seen as having positive social, cultural and economic impacts for nearly all societal variables for both employees and their neighbours. The PI eco-lodge was also perceived as reducing alcoholism, drug addiction and prostitution, where conventional tourism on the Peninsula was shown to increase these 'societal ills'. Land value and product pricing were the few variables believed to have increased as a result of tourism on the Peninsula. For conservation, the PI eco-lodge property had the highest rates of reforestation within the Nicoya Peninsula and remains the scale most reforested in both forest cover change and total forest cover. In fact, at the landscape scale, we find that the Pacific coast of the Nicoya, where the bulk of ecotourism occurs, has undergone reforestation, whereas forest interiors have been deforested. Historically, reforestation occurred as cattle ranching credit programs were halted by the government and households in the area left to find better job opportunities. The PI eco-lodge, as a source of good employment, resulted in worker migration back to the surrounding area, resulting, in some cases, in increased deforestation. Overall, we feel that the PI eco-lodge serves as an example of successful ecotourism. However, increasing development in the region, in particular by standard hotel operations and large condo developments, seeks to capitalise on the region's natural beauty and may reverse land cover trends if they are not accompanied by adequate forest conservation strategies and stresses the importance of monitoring and assessing the impacts of accommodations tied to nature-based tourism operations.

Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS (R)) Supports Marine Operations: A Look from the US Coast Guard	MARINE TECHNOLOGY SOCIETY JOURNAL												The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) is primarily a user of ocean observations but is also a provider of observations especially in high-latitude regions. USCG has a long history of making ocean observations for mission activities and in support of other federal agencies. USCG uses the Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS (R)) to understand maritime conditions while conducting the Coast Guard's roles of Maritime Safety, Maritime Security, and Maritime Stewardship. IOOS data are critical in planning search and rescue operations, ensuring safe navigation at high latitudes, responding to oil and hazardous spills, providing vessel traffic services, and maintaining maritime domain awareness (MDA). The International Ice Patrol makes and uses ocean observations to estimate drift and deterioration of icebergs. The North American Ice Service products are needed in polar and domestic ice operations. The National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration and the USCG are developing a way to disseminate the Physical Oceanographic Real-Time System data via the USCG Automatic Identification System. The Coast Guard provides personnel and vessel support for the National Data Buoy Center observational program, a component of the IOOS. Many key oceanographic, biologic, and geologic discoveries in the Arctic and Antarctic have been made from Coast Guard cutters. As oceanographic data acquisition moves from vessel observations to satellite remote sensing and unmanned in situ data acquisition systems, the USCG will continue to support this effort.																	0025-3324					NOV-DEC	2010	44	6					156	165		10.4031/MTSJ.44.6.22								WOS:000286649500020

This study was aimed at detecting coastline changes in the coastal region of Istanbul between 1987 and 2007 using remotely sensed data. Two Landsat images acquired in 1987 and 2007 with 30 m resolution were classified with the maximum likelihood supervised classification method. The study area was classified into six land cover classes comprising urban areas, agricultural areas, forest, bare soil, brush/grassland, and lakes/ponds. The study provided an in-depth analysis of the coastal changes in the study area and revealed that the coastlines of Istanbul had expanded by 32 km between 1987 and 2007. From the findings of the study, it can be concluded that the largest variations in the position of the coastline over time occurred on the Marmara Sea coast in the south of Istanbul. Consequently a sustainable coastal management plan should be prepared and put in action in order to preserve the coastal regions.																	1992-2248					OCT 4	2010	5	19					3009	3017										WOS:000284279800020

Natural disasters like hurricanes are constantly threatening these forests. Hurricane winds can have a destructive impact on natural vegetation and can adversely impact net primary productivity (NPP). Hurricane Katrina (23-30 August 2005), one of the most destructive natural disasters in history, has affected the ecological balance of the Gulf Coast. This study analyzed the impacts of different categories of sustained winds of Hurricane Katrina on NPP in Mississippi. The study used the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model to estimate NPP by using remote sensing data. The results indicated that NPP decreased by 14% in the areas hard hit by category 3 winds and by 1% in the areas hit by category 2 winds. However, there was an overall increase in NPP, from 2005 to 2006 by 0.60 Tg of carbon, in Mississippi. The authors found that Pearl River, Stone, Hancock, Jackson, and Harrison counties in Mississippi faced significant depletion of NPP because of Hurricane Katrina.

The normal faults typically consist of 4-30-km-long dip-slip segments locally organised in more complex fault zones. They separate carbonate and/or metamorphic massifs, in the footwall block, from loose to poorly consolidated alluvial and colluvial materials within the hangingwall. All these faults show clear evidences of recent re-activations and trend parallel to two principal directions: WNW-ESE and NNE-SSW. Based on all available data for both onland and offshore structures (morphological and structural mapping, satellite imagery and airphotographs remote sensing as well as the analysis of seismic profiles and the investigation of marine terraces and Holocene raised notches along the island coasts), for each fault we estimate and constrain some of the principal seismotectonic parameters and particularly the fault kinematics, the cumulative amount of slip and the slip-rate. Following simple assumptions and empirical relationships, maximum expected magnitudes and mean recurrence periods are also suggested. Summing up the contribution to crustal extension provided by the two major fault sets we calculate both arc-normal and arc-parallel long-term strain rates. The occurrence of slightly deeper and more external low-angle thrust planes associated with the incipient continental collision occurring in western Crete is also analysed. Although these contractional structures can generate stronger seismic events (M approximate to 7.5.) they are probably much rarer and thus providing a minor contribution to the overall morphotectonic evolution of the island and the forearc. A comparison of our geologically-based results with those obtained from GPS measurements show a good agreement, therefore suggesting that the present-day crustal deformation is probably active since Middle Quaternary and mainly related to the seismic activity of upper crustal normal faults characterized by frequent shallow (< 20 km) moderate-to-strong seismic events seldom alternating with stronger earthquakes occurring along blind low-angle thrust planes probably ramping from a deeper aseismic detachment (ca. 25 km). This apparently contradicting co-existence of juxtaposed upper tensional and lower compressional tectonic regimes is in agreement with the geodynamics of the region characterised by continental collision with Nubia and the Aegean mantle wedging.

This paper focuses on the characterization of sediments in a coastal environment by combining different hydrographic systems, which are a multibeam echosounder (MBES), a single-beam echosounder (SBES), and seismic systems. The area is located close to the west coast of Italy, southeast of Elba Island, which is known to be composed of very fine-grained material. Both MBES and SBES are, in general, high-frequency systems (>100 kHz), providing bathymetry and backscatter information of the upper part of the sea bottom. MBES systems provide this information with a high resolution, due to the beam opening angle of typically 1 degrees-3 degrees, and high coverage. An SBES provides measurements directly underneath the ship only, but is widespread. For the classification by means of MBES data, we use the Bayesian approach, employing backscatter measurements per beam. For the SBES, echo shape parameters are determined and are combined in a principal component analysis (PCA). Both approaches give results that are in very good agreement with respect to the distribution of different surficial sediment types. Complementary, low-frequency seismic systems (<20 kHz) give insight into the sediment layering. Combining the different acoustic approaches is shown to be an essential ingredient for establishing the environmental picture. This picture is of use for a large range of applications, such as habitat mapping, cable laying, or mine hunting. For the current research, it is aimed to act as a basis for selecting areas for subseafloor sediment classification by geoacoustic inversion techniques. Contrary to the hydrographic systems, geoacoustic inversion techniques provide the actual physical properties, i.e., densities, compression and shear wave speeds, and respective attenuations of the sediment body, and allow sediment characterization over large areas without the need to cover the complete area. A validation is given that the environmental picture, obtained by the hydrographic systems, indeed identifies regions with different acoustic properties.

J	Fontana, C; Grenz, C; Pinazo, C				Fontana, Clement; Grenz, Christian; Pinazo, Christel			Sequential assimilation of a year-long time-series of SeaWiFS chlorophyll data into a 3D biogeochemical model on the French Mediterranean coast	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												The objective of this paper was to explore the potentialities of sequential statistical estimation methods to assimilate ocean color observations in a primary production model coupled to a 3D hydrodynamic model. The study site was the gulf of Fos-Rhone delta region on the French Mediterranean coast. The high rate of primary production generally observed in this area is mainly due to strong nutrient inputs of the Rhone River. The assimilation method is derived from the singular evolutive extended Kalman filter (SEEK), which uses an error subspace represented by multivariate empirical orthogonal functions (EOF). SeaWiFS chlorophyll data were assimilated by the ecosystem model during a simulation performed under realistic meteorological conditions for the year 2001. An 'adaptive' computing method of the EOF was applied in order to lower the instabilities of the filter. Data assimilation system permitted to reduce the mean absolute error between model and data from 1.51 to 0.77 mg m(-3) thanks to the SEEK filter, showing a substantial 49% gain. Efficiency of the SEEK filter was then investigated considering several areas of interest inside the modelled domain. Finally, impact of the assimilation scheme on non-observed variables was illustrated and discussed. Throughout this experimentation the data assimilation system showed its potential regarding operational systems. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

P.			In situ and lidar observations of tropopause subvisible cirrus clouds during TC4	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												During the Tropical Composition, Clouds, and Climate Coupling (TC4) experiment in July-August 2007, the NASA WB-57F and ER-2 aircraft made coordinated flights through a tropopause subvisible cirrus (SVC) layer off the Pacific Coast of Central America. The ER-2 aircraft was equipped with a remote sensing payload that included the cloud physics lidar (CPL). The WB-57F payload included cloud microphysical and trace gas measurements, and the aircraft made four vertical profiles through the SVC layer shortly after the ER-2 flew over. The in situ and remotely sensed data are used to quantify the meteorological and microphysical properties of the SVC layer, and these data are compared to the limited set of SVC measurements that have previously been made. It is found that the layer encountered was particularly tenuous, with optical depths (tau) between about 10(-4) and 10(-3). From the in situ and other meteorological data, radiative heating rate perturbations of similar to 0.05-0.1 K day(-1) are calculated. These heating rates are smaller than previous estimates for tropopause SVC, consistent with the smaller tau in the present study. Coverage statistics based on CPL data from other TC4 flights indicate that this cloud was not an outlier among the sampled population. SVC with properties similar to the one presented here are below the detection limit of space-based lidars such as CALIPSO, and a comparison with the TC4 statistics suggests that a majority (> 50%) of tropopause SVC (with tau < 0.01) could be unaccounted for in studies using CALIPSO data.

Low-ozone bubbles observed in the tropical tropopause layer during the TC4 campaign in 2007	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												In the summer of 2007, the NASA DC-8 aircraft took part in the Tropical Composition, Cloud and Climate Coupling campaign based in San Jose, Costa Rica. During this campaign, multiple in situ and remote-sensing instruments aboard the aircraft measured the atmospheric composition of the tropical tropopause layer (TTL) in the equatorial region around Central and South America. During the 17 July flight off the Ecuadorian coast, well-defined "bubbles" of anomalously low-ozone concentration (less than 75 ppbv) were detected above the aircraft in the TTL at the altitude near 365 K (between 14 and 16 km) and at similar to 3 degrees S and similar to 82 degrees W. Backward trajectories from meteorological analyses and the aircraft in situ measurements suggest that the ozone-depleted air mass originated from deep convection in the equatorial eastern Pacific and/or Panama Bight regions at least 5 days before observation by the DC-8; this was not a feature produced by local convection. Given uncertainties known in regard to trajectories calculated from global reanalysis, it is not possible to identify the exact convective system that produced this particular low-ozone anomaly, but only the general origin from a region of high convective activity. However, the fact that the feature apparently maintained its coherency for at least 5 days suggests a significant contribution to the chemical composition of the tropical upper troposphere portion of the TTL from convective systems followed by quasi-horizontal transport. It also suggests that mixing time scales for these relatively small spatial features are greater than 5 days.

J	Ceyhun, O; Yalcin, A				Ceyhun, Oezcelik; Yalcin, Arisoy			Remote sensing of water depths in shallow waters via artificial neural networks	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Determination of the water depths in coastal zones is a common requirement for the majority of coastal engineering and coastal science applications. However, production of high quality bathymetric maps requires expensive field survey, high technology equipment and expert personnel. Remotely sensed images can be conveniently used to reduce the cost and labor needed for bathymetric measurements and to overcome the difficulties in spatial and temporal depth provision. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methodology is introduced in this study to derive bathymetric maps in shallow waters via remote sensing images and sample depth measurements. This methodology provides fast and practical solution for depth estimation in shallow waters, coupling temporal and spatial capabilities of remote sensing imagery with modeling flexibility of ANN. Its main advantage in practice is that it enables to directly use image reflectance values in depth estimations, without refining depth-caused scatterings from other environmental factors (e.g. bottom material and vegetation). Its function-free structure allows evaluating nonlinear relationships between multi-band images and in-situ depth measurements, therefore leads more reliable depth estimations than classical regressive approaches. The west coast of the Foca, Izmir/Turkey was used as a test bed. Aster first three band images and Quickbird pan-sharpened images were used to derive ANN based bathymetric maps of this study area. In-situ depth measurements were supplied from the General Command of Mapping, Turkey (HGK). Two models were set, one for Aster and one for Quickbird image inputs. Bathymetric maps relying solely on in-situ depth measurements were used to evaluate resultant derived bathymetric maps. The efficiency of the methodology was discussed at the end of the paper. It is concluded that the proposed methodology could decrease spatial and repetitive depth measurement requirements in bathymetric mapping especially for preliminary engineering application.

GONDWANA RESEARCH												The Lake Alaotra-Ankay rift valley of Central Madagascar forms a NE-SW oriented depression filled with Neogene to recent sediments and is part of a more regional post-Miocene graben system that strikes N-S across much of the central part of the island. The region is characterized by a number of small earthquakes, active hot springs, steep fault-scarp bounded valleys, and several levels of terraces. Young, deeply incised topography related to intense tropical weathering, is largely concentrated near active fault systems. The origin and evolution of this extensional structure and its morphological expressions, however, have not been clearly documented. Mountain front sinuosity values indicate that the eastern side of the rift valley is tectonically more active than the western side, and that rapid erosion under subtropical conditions is causing rapid weathering of fault scarps. The active river network within the Alaotra-Ankay rift shows clear signs of surface re-adjustment to recent tectonic activity. The drainage network is asymmetric, with most channels on the east sides of valleys and controlled by regional eastward tilting. First-order rivers flow parallel to the basin axis. Zones of intense lavaka (erosional gully) formation are correlated with active fault systems and seismicity. Extension in the Ankay-Alaotra rift is oriented roughly the same as in the morphologically similar East African rift system, located only 500 km to the west. The eastern edge of the African continent is moving somewhat independently from the rest of Africa and the portion of the African plate east of the East African rift is regarded as a separate plate, the Somali plate. However, few plate configurations have clearly defined the southern extension of the Africa-Somali plate boundary to where it must join the Southwest Indian Ocean ridge, a necessary requirement of any true microplate bounded by plate boundaries. Instead, the southeast part of the African plate, including the Somali microplate, seems to be dominated by a number of individual rift systems, overall defining a broad diffusive extensional plate boundary. We suggest that this diffusive plate boundary includes one segment that extends off the coast of Africa through the Comores, then cuts through northern Madagascar and extends down the active Ankay-Alaotra rift to the fault-block dominated southeastern coast of Madagascar, then extends southeastward to the Southwest Indian Ocean Ridge. Thus, the southeastern part of the African plate is considerably more fragmented by plume-related uplift and diffuse extensional boundaries than previously envisaged.

J	Klemas, V				Klemas, Victor			Tracking Oil Slicks and Predicting their Trajectories Using Remote Sensors and Models: Case Studies of the Sea Princess and Deepwater Horizon Oil Spills	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Oil spills can harm marine life in the oceans, estuaries, and wetlands. To limit the damage by a spill and facilitate cleanup efforts, emergency managers need information on spill location, size and extent, direction and speed of oil movement, and wind, current, and wave information for predicting oil drift and dispersion. The main operational data requirements are fast turn-around time and frequent imaging to monitor the dynamics of the spill. Remote sensors on satellites and aircraft meet most of these requirements by tracking the spilled oil at various resolutions, over wide areas, and at frequent intervals. They also provide key inputs to drift prediction models and facilitate targeting of skimming and booming efforts. Satellite data are frequently supplemented by information provided by aircraft, ships, and remotely-controlled underwater robots. The Sea Princess tanker grounding off the coast of Wales and the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig in the Gulf of Mexico provide good examples for studying the effectiveness of remote sensors during oil-spill emergencies.																	0749-0208					SEP	2010	26	5					789	797		10.2112/10A-00012.1								WOS:000282358200001

Shoreline changes and morphology of spits along southern Karnataka, west coast of India: A remote sensing and statistics-based approach	GEOMORPHOLOGY												The changes in shoreline positions and morphology of spits along the Karnataka coast, western India, are investigated for the period from 1910 to 2005 using multi-dated satellite images and topomaps. The study area has been divided into four littoral cells, and each cell into a number of transects at uniform intervals. The rate of change in shoreline position has been estimated using the statistical linear regression method and cross-validated with regression coefficient (R(2)) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) methods. Past and future shoreline positions have been demarcated and future positions of shoreline are estimated for time periods of 10- and 24-years. The study reveals that (i) about 57% of transects exhibit +/- 10 m RMSE values, indicating better agreement between the estimated and satellite-based shoreline positions, and (ii) transects closer to the cell boundaries exhibit about 50% uncertainties in shoreline change rate estimations. Based on RMSE values, the influence of natural processes and anthropogenic factors on shoreline changes has been evaluated. The cells/transects dominated by natural processes reveal low RMSE values, whereas the cells/transects influenced by anthropogenic activities such as sand mining, construction of coastal structures, exhibit higher RMSE values. However, the variation in RMSE values is not significant if the total number of transects is considered. Significant changes in morphology of spits have been recorded. Spits demonstrate variations in areal extent, i.e., length and area, if 1910 and 1967 are considered separately as base years. The present study demonstrates that combined use of satellite imagery and statistical techniques such as linear regression and RMSEs can be very useful in quantifying shoreline changes and spit morphology.

Coastline change detection with satellite remote sensing for environmental management of the Pearl River Estuary, China	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												The Pearl River delta area in Guangdong Province has one of the highest economic development rates of China. Rapid industrialization and urbanization has resulted in extensive changes in land use, including the construction of harbours and embankments. The lack of sustainable coastal zone management has caused severe environmental problems, such as land subsidence, intrusion of sea water, siltation of river channels and coastal erosion. For the analysis of the changes of the coastlines, multi-temporal Landsat images and a SPOT scene have been used, in combination with topographical and nautical data. From the change analysis, it can be concluded that the largest variations in the position of the coastline over time occurred in the Nansha Development Zone, situated in the Northern part of Lingdingyang bay. Sedimentation and land reclamation was responsible for the growth of the islands in the period 1960 to 2000, which however decreased slightly in the years after. Various large changes occurred also in the East of the bay along the coast of Shekou peninsula, caused by extensive harbour construction and growth of polder systems. Based on the research of the coastline change in recent decades, suspended sediment plume distribution and its sedimentation, it is suggested that the western part of the waterway in the estuary may not be suitable for large number of construction for harbours, due to the sedimentation and fill up. One of the most important impacts of the coastline changes in the Pearl River Estuary is the narrowing down and extension of river channel which results in more floods in the upper part of the river.

J	Kuleli, T				Kuleli, Tuncay			Quantitative analysis of shoreline changes at the Mediterranean Coast in Turkey	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												This research is focused on the coastline evolution monitoring and its potential change estimation by remote sensing techniques using multi-temporal Landsat images at the southeast coasts of the Mediterranean Sea in Turkey. The study area includes the coastal zone located in the Cukurova Delta coasts. The Cukurova Delta has accreted toward the Mediterranean Sea as a result of sediment discharge and transport from Seyhan and Ceyhan rivers. These processes have caused the morphological changes (accretion or erosion) of coastline along some parts of the southeast coasts of the Mediterranean Sea. In this study, coastline changes were researched by using radiometrically and geometrically corrected multi-temporal and multi-spectral data from Landsat Multispectral Scanner dated 1972, Thematic Mapper dated 1987, and Enhanced Thematic Mapper dated 2002. In the image processing steps, mosaicing, subset, Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique classification, band ratioing (B5/B2), edge detection, and overlay techniques were used to carry out coastline extraction and the Digital Shoreline Analysis System was used to calculate rate of coastline changes. As a result of the analysis, in some parts of the research area, remarkable coastline changes (more than 2,900 m withdrawal and -aEuro parts per thousand 24.50 m/year erosion) were observed for a 30-year period.

Specifically, the mangroves of the estuarine islands of Mabala and Y,litono were classified using satellite and airborne optical remote sensing data. Mangroves were mapped according to four classes: tall red (Rhizophora racemosa), medium red (R. racemosa), dwarf red (R. mangle and R. harisonii), and black mangrove (Avicennia germinans). Producer's and user's accuracies for the mapping of mangrove from non-mangrove areas were both 98%. When separating amongst the mangrove classes most of the confusion resulted from the medium red mangrove class. Of the 10,442 ha of mangrove mapped, approximately 30% were classified as riverine, dominated by tall R. racemosa. The remaining mangrove areas were dominated by dwarf mangrove of either Rhizophora or A. germinans. Biophysical parameter data collected from 56 transects varied considerably amongst the classes. For the tallest mangrove class, the mean values of height, DBH, estimated LAI, stem density and basal area recorded were 13 m, 15.1 cm, 4.3, 838 stems/ha, and 25.9 m(2)/ha, respectively. In contrast, for A. germinans, values of 3 m, 4.6 cm, 1.5, 2,877 stems/ha, and 6.0 m(2)/ha were calculated, respectively.

J	Kearney, MS; Rogers, AS				Kearney, M. S.; Rogers, A. S.			Forecasting sites of future coastal marsh loss using topographical relationships and logistic regression	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												The last two assessments of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predict that rates of sea level rise will begin to accelerate by c. 2030-2040 CE. Considering that many marsh systems are already under threat from existing sea level trends, a dramatic upswing in rate only a few decades away poses critical questions about what the future may hold for these marshes (and those yet to manifest sea level impacts) requires coast-wide assessments. Extrapolations of detailed historical trends traditionally have provided the least equivocal way of providing such information, but the necessary data required for this approach are often lacking. In this paper, we describe how logistic regression analysis applied to spatial data on marsh loss and degradation-in this case derived from a validated Landsat-based marsh condition model-and its relation to such readily determined parameters as distance from shorelines or tidal creeks can be used to predict where future marsh losses may occur, even in those systems not presently affected. As such, it affords more targeted information for planning than can be had from general submergence versus accretion/elevation change models (e.g., SLAMM) that are limited by the paucity of vertical accretion data. The results also reinforce the concept that marsh adjustment to sea level rise can be broadly deduced at the landscape level, which in some respects is independent of marsh type and is responsive to tidal frame and coastal profile.																	0923-4861					AUG	2010	18	4					449	461		10.1007/s11273-010-9178-y								WOS:000280074900004

It is the sole freshwater source for human users and ecosystems. The region hosts internationally important groundwater-dependent ecosystems (GDEs) in the 5280 km(2) Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve. The GDEs are threatened by increasing groundwater abstractions and risks of pollution. Hydrogeological exploration work is needed as basis for sound groundwater management. A multidisciplinary approach was used to study this data-scarce region. Geochemical data and phreatic surface measurements showed distinct hydrogeological units in the groundwater catchment of Sian Ka'an. The hilly southwestern areas had a low hydraulic permeability, likely caused by a geology containing gypsum, whereas the transition zone and flat areas in the east and north had a high permeability. In the latter areas, the fresh groundwater could be described by a Dupuit-Ghyben-Herzberg lens. Geophysical borehole logging and time-domain electromagnetic soundings identified a shallow, low-resistive and high-gamma-radiation layer present throughout the hilly area and transition zone. Its thickness was 3-8 m, apparent conductivity was 200-800 mS/m and natural gamma-radiation about 80 counts pr. second. The layer is proposed to be ejecta from the Chicxulub impact (Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary). Spatial estimates of recharge were calculated from MODIS imagery using the 'triangle method'. Average recharge constituted 17% of mean annual precipitation in the study area. Recharge was greatest in the hilly area and towards Valladolid.

We compare forest carbon estimates from Light Detection and Ranging (Lidar) data and QuickBird high-resolution satellite images, calibrated and validated by field measurements of individual trees. We conducted the tests at two sites in California: (1) 59 km(2) of secondary and old-growth coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) forest (Garcia-Mailliard area) and (2) 58 km(2) of old-growth Sierra Nevada forest (North Yuba area). Regression of aboveground live tree carbon density, calculated from field measurements, against Lidar height metrics and against QuickBird-derived tree crown diameter generated equations of carbon density as a function of the remote sensing parameters. Employing Monte Carlo methods, we quantified uncertainties of forest carbon estimates from uncertainties in field measurements, remote sensing accuracy, biomass regression equations, and spatial autocorrelation. Validation of QuickBird crown diameters against field measurements of the same trees showed significant correlation (r=0.82, P<0.05). Comparison of stand-level Lidar height metrics with field-derived Lorey's mean height showed significant correlation (Garcia-Mailliard r=0.94, P<0.0001: North Yuba R=0.89, P<0.0001). Field measurements of five aboveground carbon pools (live trees, dead trees, shrubs, coarse woody debris, and litter) yielded aboveground carbon densities (mean +/- standard error without Monte Carlo) as high as 320 +/- 35 Mg ha(-1) (old-growth coast redwood) and 510 +/- 120 Mg ha(-1) (red fir [Abies magnifica] forest), as great or greater than tropical rainforest. Lidar and QuickBird detected aboveground carbon in live trees, 70-97% of the total. Large sample sizes in the Monte Carlo analyses of remote sensing data generated low estimates of uncertainty. Lidar showed lower uncertainty and higher accuracy than QuickBird, due to high correlation of biomass to height and undercounting of trees by the crown detection algorithm. Lidar achieved uncertainties of <1%, providing estimates of aboveground live tree carbon density (mean +/- 95% confidence interval with Monte Carlo) of 82 +/- 0.7 Mg ha(-1) in Garda-Mailliard and 140 +/- 0.9 Mg ha(-1) in North Yuba. The method that we tested, combining field measurements, Lidar, and Monte Carlo, can produce robust wall-to-wall spatial data on forest carbon. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Decorrelation of L-Band and C-Band Interferometry Over Vegetated Areas in California	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING												Temporal decorrelation is one of the main limitations for recovering interseismic deformation along the San Andreas Fault system using interferometric synthetic aperture radar. To assess the improved correlation properties of L-band with respect to C-band, we analyzed L-band Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS) interferograms with a range of temporal and spatial baselines over three vegetated areas in California and compared them with corresponding C-band European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS) interferograms. Over the highly vegetated Northern California forests in the Coast Range area, ALOS remains remarkably well correlated over a 2-year period, whereas an ERS interferogram with a similar temporal and spatial baseline lost correlation. In Central California near Parkfield, we found a similar pattern in decorrelation behavior, which enabled the recovery of a fault creep and a local uplifting signal at L-band that was not apparent at C-band. In the Imperial Valley in Southern California, both ALOS and ERS have low correlation over farmlands. ALOS has lower correlation over some sandy surfaces than ERS, probably due to low signal-to-noise ratio. In general, L-band interferograms with similar seasonal acquisitions have higher correlation than those with dissimilar season. For both L-and C-band, correlation over vegetated areas decreases with time for intervals less than 1 year and then remains relatively constant at longer time intervals. The decorrelation time for L-band is more than 2 years in the forest in California whereas that for C-band is less than 6 months. Overall, these results suggest that L-band interferograms will reveal near-fault interseismic deformation once sufficient data become available.

Comparisons of Daily Sea Surface Temperature Analyses for 2007-08	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												Six different SST analyses are compared with each other and with buoy data for the period 2007-08. All analyses used different combinations of satellite data [for example, infrared Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and microwave Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR) instruments] with different algorithms, spatial resolution, etc. The analyses considered are theNationalClimaticDataCenter (NCDC) AVHRR-only and AMSR + AVHRR, the Navy Coupled Ocean Data Assimilation (NCODA), the Remote Sensing Systems (RSS), the Real-Time Global High-Resolution (RTG-HR), and the Operational SST and Sea Ice Analysis (OSTIA); the spatial grid sizes were 1/4 degrees, 1/4 degrees, 1/9 degrees, 1/11 degrees, 1/12 degrees, and 1/20 degrees, respectively. In addition, all analyses except RSS used in situ data. Most analysis procedures and weighting functions differed. Thus, differences among analyses could be large in high-gradient and data-sparse regions. An example off the coast of South Carolina showed winter SST differences that exceeded 5 degrees C. To help quantify SST analysis differences, wavenumber spectra were computed at several locations. These results suggested that the RSS is much noisier and that the RTG-HR analysis is much smoother than the other analyses. Further comparisons made using collocated buoys showed that RSS was especially noisy in the tropics and that RTG-HRhad winter biases near the Aleutians region during January and February 2007. The correlation results show that NCODA and, to a somewhat lesser extent, OSTIA are strongly tuned locally to buoy data. The results also show that grid spacing does not always correlate with analysis resolution. The AVHRR-only analysis is useful for climate studies because it is the only daily SST analysis that extends back to September 1981. Furthermore, comparisons of the AVHRR-only analysis and the AMSR+AVHRR analysis show that AMSR data can degrade the combined AMSR and AVHRR resolution in cloud-free regions while AMSR otherwise improves the resolution. These results indicate that changes in satellite instruments over time can impact SST analysis resolution.																	0894-8755					JUL	2010	23	13					3545	3562		10.1175/2010JCLI3294.1								WOS:000280101500008

Use of Archive Aerial Photography for Monitoring Black Mangrove Populations	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												A study was conducted on the South Texas Gulf Coast to evaluate archive aerial color-infrared (CIR) photography combined with supervised image analysis techniques to quantify changes in black mangrove [Avicennia germinans (L.) L.] populations over a 26-year period. Archive CIR film from two study sites (sites 1 and 2) was studied. Photographs of site 1 from 1976, 1988, and 2002 showed that black mangrove populations made up 16.2%, 21.1%, and 29.4% of the study site, respectively. Photographs of site 2 from 1976 and 2002 showed that black mangrove populations made up 0.4% and 2.7% of the study site, respectively. Over the 26-year period, black mangrove had increases in cover of 77% and 467% on sites 1 and 2, respectively. These results indicate that aerial photographs coupled with image analysis techniques can be useful tools to monitor and quantify black mangrove populations over time.																	0749-0208					JUL	2010	26	4					649	653		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-09-00133.1								WOS:000280210500006						
J	Meleder, V; Populus, J; Guillaumont, B; Perrot, T; Mouquet, P				Meleder, Vona; Populus, Jacques; Guillaumont, Brigitte; Perrot, Thierry; Mouquet, Pascal			Predictive modelling of seabed habitats: case study of subtidal kelp forests on the coast of Brittany, France	MARINE BIOLOGY												Predictive modelling to map subtidal communities is an alternative to "traditional" methods, such as direct sampling, remote sensing and acoustic survey, which are neither time- nor cost-effective for vast expanses. The principle of this modelling is the use of a combination of environmental key parameters to produce rules to understand species distribution and hence generate predictive maps. This study focuses on subtidal kelp forests (KF) on the coast of Brittany, France. The most significant key parameters to predict KF frequency are (1) the nature of the substrate, (2) depth, (3) water transparency, (4) water surface temperature and (5) hydrodynamics associated with the flexibility of algae in a flow. All these parameters are integrated in a spatial model, built using a Geographical Information System. This model results in a KF frequency map, where sites with optimum key parameters show a deeper limit of disappearance. After validation, the model is used in the context of Climate Change to estimate the effect of environmental variation on this depth limit of KF. Thus, the effects of both an increase in water temperature and a decrease in its transparency could lead to the complete disappearance of KF.

This heterogeneity reduces the efficacy of control strategies, but also implies that focusing control strategies on "hotspots'' of transmission could be highly effective. Methods and Findings: In order to identify hotspots of malaria transmission, we analysed longitudinal data on febrile malaria episodes, asymptomatic parasitaemia, and antibody titres over 12 y from 256 homesteads in three study areas in Kilifi District on the Kenyan coast. We examined heterogeneity by homestead, and identified groups of homesteads that formed hotspots using a spatial scan statistic. Two types of statistically significant hotspots were detected; stable hotspots of asymptomatic parasitaemia and unstable hotspots of febrile malaria. The stable hotspots were associated with higher average AMA-1 antibody titres than the unstable clusters (optical density [OD] = 1.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.47 versus OD=1.1, 95% CI 0.88-1.33) and lower mean ages of febrile malaria episodes (5.8 y, 95% CI 5.6-6.0 versus 5.91 y, 95% CI 5.7-6.1). A falling gradient of febrile malaria incidence was identified in the penumbrae of both hotspots. Hotspots were associated with AMA-1 titres, but not seroconversion rates. In order to target control measures, homesteads at risk of febrile malaria could be predicted by identifying the 20% of homesteads that experienced an episode of febrile malaria during one month in the dry season. That 20% subsequently experienced 65% of all febrile malaria episodes during the following year. A definition based on remote sensing data was 81% sensitive and 63% specific for the stable hotspots of asymptomatic malaria. Conclusions: Hotspots of asymptomatic parasitaemia are stable over time, but hotspots of febrile malaria are unstable. This finding may be because immunity offsets the high rate of febrile malaria that might otherwise result in stable hotspots, whereas unstable hotspots necessarily affect a population with less prior exposure to malaria.

PARISFOG Shedding New Light on Fog Physical Processes	BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY												Fog is a weather condition with significant socioeconomic impacts associated with increased hazards and constraints in road, maritime, and air traffic. While current numerical weather prediction models are able to forecast situations that are favorable to fog events, it is very difficult to determine the exact location and time of formation or dissipation. One-dimensional assimilation-forecast models have been implemented at a few airports and provide improved local predictions of fog events, but this approach is limited to specific locations. The occurrence, development, and dissipation of fog result from multiple processes (thermodynamical, radiative, dynamical, microphysical) that occur simultaneously, through a wide range of conditions, and that interact nonlinearly with each other. Hence, to advance our ability to forecast fog processes, we must gain a better understanding of how critical physical processes feed back on each other and improve their parametric representations in models. To provide a dataset suitable to study these processes simultaneously in continental fog, a suite of active and passive remote sensing instruments and in situ sensors was deployed at the Site Instrumental de Recherche en Teledetection Atmospherique (SIRTA; instrumented site for atmospheric remote sensing research) observatory, near Paris, France, for 6 months (winter 2006/07) to monitor profiles of wind, turbulence, microphysical, and radiative properties as well as temperature, humidity, aerosol, and fog droplet microphysics and chemical composition in the surface layer. This field experiment, called ParisFog, provides a comprehensive characterization of over 100 fog and near-fog events. The ParisFog dataset contains contrasted events of stratus-lowering fog and radiative cooling fog as well as a large number of situations considered as favorable to fog formation but where fog droplets did not materialize. The effect of hydrated aerosols on visibility, the role of aerosols' microphysical and chemical properties on supersaturation and droplet activation, and the role of turbulence and sedimentation on fog life cycles have been investigated using the ParisFog dataset. The interactions between these processes, however, remain to be explored.

J	Henry, LA; Davies, AJ; Roberts, JM				Henry, Lea-Anne; Davies, Andrew J.; Roberts, J. Murray			Beta diversity of cold-water coral reef communities off western Scotland	CORAL REEFS												Spatial heterogeneity in coral reef communities is well documented. This "species turnover" (beta diversity) on shallow warm-water reefs strongly conforms to spatial gradients in the environment as well as spatially autocorrelated biotic processes such as dispersal and competition. But the extent to which the environment and spatial autocorrelation create beta diversity on deep cold-water coral reefs such as those formed by Lophelia pertusa (Scleractinia) is unknown. The effects of remotely sensed and ground-truthed data were tested on the community composition of sessile suspension-feeding communities from the Mingulay Reef Complex, a landscape of inshore Lophelia reefs off the Scottish west coast. Canonical correspondence analysis determined that a statistically significant proportion (68%) of the variance in community composition could be explained by remotely sensed environmental variables (northerly and easterly aspect, seabed rugosity, depth), ground-truthed environmental variables (species richness and reef macrohabitat) and geospatial location. This variation was further partitioned into fractions explained by pure effects of the environment (51%), spatially structured environmental variables (12%) and spatial autocorrelation (5%). Beta diversity in these communities reflected the effects of both measured and unmeasured and spatially dependent environmental variables that vary across the reef complex, i.e., hydrography. Future work will quantify the significance and relative contributions of these variables in creating beta diversity in these rich communities.

A Hybrid Scheme was introduced that sequentially applies the optimized versions of two pre-existing satellite-based algorithms: an Empirical Approach (using water-leaving radiance as a function of chlorophyll concentration) and a Bio-optical Technique (using particulate backscatter along with chlorophyll concentration). The long-term evaluation of the new multi-algorithm method was performed using a multi-year MODIS dataset (2002-2006; during the boreal Summer-Fall periods - July-December) along the Central West Florida Shelf between 25.75 degrees N and 28.25 degrees N. Algorithm validation was done with in situ measurements of the abundances of K. brevis: cell counts >= 1.5 x 10(4) cells I-1 defined a detectable HAB. Encouraging statistical results were derived when either or both algorithms correctly flagged known samples. The majority of the valid match-ups were correctly identified (similar to 80% of both HABs and non-blooming conditions) and few false negatives or false positives were produced (similar to 20% of each). Additionally, most of the HAB-positive identifications in the satellite data were indeed HAB samples (positive predictive value: similar to 70%) and those classified as HAB-negative were almost all non-bloom cases (negative predictive value: similar to 86%). These results demonstrate an excellent detection capability, on average similar to 10% more accurate than the individual algorithms used separately. Thus, the new Hybrid Scheme could become a powerful tool for environmental monitoring of K. brevis blooms, with valuable consequences including leading to the more rapid and efficient use of ships to make in situ measurements of HABs.

Before studying bar dynamics with video images, we must establish the relationship between the real bar positions and the videoed bar positions (detected by the preferential wave breaking on the shallows). This analysis becomes essential in the two studied tideless beaches of Barcelona due to the critical differences with respect to the sites studied previously. Bogatell beach is terraced (without a trough) in more than 50% of the profiles. There, the videoed barlines are a good proxy of the terrace edge position. In La Barceloneta beach, with dominance of barred profiles, the videoed barlines better represent the bar crest position. On average, the obtained distances between real and videoed bar positions Delta r are 10-15 m, with the videoed barlines located shoreward. Changes in the bathymetric profile shape and the root-mean-squared wave height H(rms) induce a variability of Delta r of 16 m in La Barceloneta and 13 m in Bogatell. This apparent variability masks the real changes in bar position and should preferably be reduced before further analysis. As a highly significant correlation between Delta r and H(rms) is detected in the two beaches, the proposed reduction method consists of sampling at a specific range of H(rms). This diminishes the variability by 10% to 14 m in La Barceloneta and 11 m in Bogatell. This paper confirms the suitability of using video systems for monitoring bars and terraces in the Barcelona beaches.

The present study was conducted using remote sensing methods and a geographical information system with the aim of quantifying the participation of this activity in the reduction of the mangrove areas along the northern coast of the State of Pernambuco (northeast, Brazil), where shrimp farming has been implanted in last recent years. From 1973 to 2005, there was reduction of about 2.052 ha of mangrove, 197 ha of which were converted into shrimp ponds. Thus, the real contribution of shrimp farming to this reduction was just 9.6% of the total area.

The Landsat TM images from 1992 to 2003 were analyzed to identify salt-marsh vegetation distribution patterns and their changes over this coastal region, in order to evaluate the effects of the spreading of the artificially introduced halophyte Spartina. Supervised classification was performed using Bands 3, 4 and 5 in conjunction with in situ training samples, to derive the distribution pattern of the vegetation in the study area. Further, in order to identify the intertidal areas with different tidal elevations, a data treatment procedure was designed to combine regional water level data using harmonic analysis with the waterlines on the TM images extracted by density slice. The results show that: (1) the Spartina alterniflora area has been expanding towards the sea rapidly since it was introduced, especially at initial stages; (2) in the upper part of the inter-tidal zone, the local marsh plant Suaeda salsa and the exotic species Spartina anglica were present only near the sea dyke, occupying only a small part of the entire salt marsh, and the area of these two species has been reduced by land reclamation; (3) there has been a trend for Spartina alterniflora to become the dominant species in the salt marshes in the study area; and (4) the elevation of Spartina alterniflora's seaward fringe was close to mean high water on neaps, and its landward boundary was slightly higher than mean high water. The salt marsh environment of the study area has been modified rapidly by the Spartina vegetation for the last 12 years.

The evolution of land subsidence has been monitored between 1996 and 2000 with few leveling stations. Hence, maps show an overall distribution of land subsidence, but are inaccurate in detail. Stable points network (SPN) technique has been applied to improve land-subsidence mapping. SPN measures ground motion using Synthetic Aperture Radar satellite images. For the SPN processing, 35 radar satellite images acquired between 2002 and 2006 have been selected. Derived land-subsidence rates vary from fractions of 1 mm/year to values of 10 cm/year and even beyond. Classification and visualization of the ground motion data illustrate the boundary between mainly stable ground in the south of Semarang and increasingly land-subsidence-affected land toward the coast. Final result is a map featuring the land subsidence with much higher accuracy as had been possible before. This article presents a brief description of the land subsidence in Semarang and introduces briefly the concept of SPN technique.

Coastal Vulnerability Assessment for Orissa State, East Coast of India	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Coastal areas of Orissa State in the northeastern part of the Indian peninsula are potentially vulnerable to accelerated erosion hazard Along the 480-km coastline, most of the coastal areas, including tourist resorts, hotels, fishing villages, and towns, are already threatened by recurring storm flood events and severe coastal erosion The coastal habitats, namely the largest rookeries in the world for olive Ridley sea turtles (the extensive sandy beaches of Gahirmatha and Rushikulya), Asia's largest brackish water lagoon (the "Chihka"), extensive mangrove cover of Bhitarkanika (the wildlife sanctuary), the estuarine systems, and deltaic plains are no exception The present study therefore is an attempt to develop a coastal vulnerability index (CVI) for the maritime state of Orissa using eight relative risk variables Most of these parameters are dynamic in nature and require a large amount of data from different sources In some cases, the base data is from remote sensing satellites, for others It is either from long-term in situ measurements or from numerical models Zones of vulnerability to coastal natural hazards of different magnitude (high, medium, and low) are identified and shown on a map In earlier studies, tidal range was assumed to include both permanent and episodic inundation hazards However, the mean of the long-term tidal records tends to dampen the effect of episodic inundation hazards such as tsunamis For this reason, in the present study, tsunami run-up has been considered as an additional physical process parameter to calculate the CVI Coastal regional elevation has also been considered as an additional important variable This is the first such study that has been undertaken for a part of the Indian coastline The map prepared for the Orissa coast under this study can be used by the state and district administration involved in the disaster mitigation and management plan																	0749-0208					MAY	2010	26	3					523	534		10.2112/09-1186.1								WOS:000277947000014

Re-evaluation of 'paradox of mesozooplankton' in the eastern Arabian Sea based on ship and satellite observations	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												In the central and eastern Arabian Sea (EAS), biomass and production of phytoplankton are known to vary spatially and seasonally whereas, biomass of mesozooplankton (MSP) is reported to be constant. This apparent contradiction has been called 'Arabian Sea Paradox'. However, it is important to note that the paradox is based on a very limited seasonal data (from 5 to 7 locations). Therefore, we reconsidered the paradox based on intensive in-situ observations at 37-40 locations in the EAS. In agreement with the known seasonal difference in phytoplankton standing stock in the EAS, we analysed the MSP data in two ways using two-way nested ANOVA. In 'basin scale' analysis, MSP data from the EAS were pooled and seasonal and inshore-offshore variations were analysed for the entire region. In 'regional scale' analysis, MSP data were analysed separately for (a) northern region (north of 15 degrees N) and (b) southern region (15 degrees N and south of it). Satellite data of chlorophyll a, SST and wind speed were also analysed to show the major differences in oceanographic features in the northern and southern EAS. The analyses showed prominently high chlorophyll a (ay. 1 mg m(-3)) in the northern region during most of the year through winter convection, open ocean upwelling and lateral advection from the Arabian coast. On the other hand, chlorophyll a was low (ay. 0.2 mg m(-3)) in the southern region during most of the year mainly due to thermohaline stratification. The MSP biomass was distributed almost in a similar way as that of phytoplankton stock with statistically significant spatial and seasonal variations ill the northern and southern regions. In this paper, we review the 'paradox of MSP' and present clear and new evidences to show that this concept is not logically applicable for EAS. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Anatomy of shelf-deep sea exchanges by a mesoscale eddy in the North West Black Sea as derived from remotely sensed data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Satellite derived full resolution data on chlorophyll, water leaving radiance, sea surface temperature, as well as altimetry data are used to characterise the process of shelf-open sea exchange induced by an individual mesoscale eddy off the North West coast of the Black Sea in the summer 2005. The shelf edge front in the NW part of the Black Sea separates biologically productive and often eutrophicated shelf waters from the open sea waters. A large mesoscale eddy (diameter about 120 km) was formed away from the shelf front southwest of Crimean peninsula in the spring 2005. The eddy moved towards the shelf break and repeatedly attached itself to the shelf edge front causing its disturbance and formation of a cross-shelf jet and a Chl-a rich filament spiralling around the eddy periphery. The jet represented an important cross-shelf transport mechanism sustaining an average cross-frontal flux of shelf waters of 0.3 Sv over period of 40 days. The total transport of water in our case study was equivalent to 40% of the overall volume of water on the shelf. Formation of the filament significantly increased the length of contact between shelf and deep sea waters from 70 km at the base of filament to about 800 km along its sides, thus providing a highly efficient mixing mechanism.

The region is composed of multiple geological domains and has undergone extensive tectonic activity, uplift, and deformation, producing multiple unconformity surfaces. In addition, multiple phases of intrusion, some with volcanic cover sequences, add to the complexity of the geological model. This study concentrates on establishing a basic framework of the spatial relationships between individual lithological units and their contained mineral deposits from remotely sensed data. Of primary interest is providing basic lithological discrimination, which could form the basis of future field mapping. Multiple thematic maps were produced from compilations of satellite imagery, aerial photography, high-resolution digital elevation maps (DEMs), airborne radiometrics, and aeromagnetics. Common edge boundaries within the geophysical and spectral data were used to discriminate regions having similar physical and mineralogical signatures. The resulting patterns provide a proxy, or remote predictive method, for recognition of the distinct geological features within the study area. Furthermore, the techniques and methods introduced in this paper can be applied to other areas for producing presurvey geological templates.																	1712-7971					APR	2010	36	2					99	118		10.5589/m10-031								WOS:000282145100003

Environmental Monitoring of Bombetoka Bay and the Betsiboka Estuary, Madagascar, Using Multi-temporal Satellite Data	JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCE												The causes and consequences of soil erosion in Madagascar have been the focus of recent environmental debates. The Betsiboka, Madagascar's largest river stretching 600 km from the high central plateau to the northwest coast on the Mozambique Channel, is a major conduit for transporting lateritic soils and sediments derived from the highlands of Central Madagascar to the sea. These entrained lateritic sediments color the river a blood-red hue, as if the life of the island is being drained away. In this study, Landsat visible and near infrared spectral bands are used to map the underwater sediments especially under the sea and in the interface between seawater and freshwater. Band color composites, single bands and band ratios are used to improve the detection of underwater sediments including sand bars and delta lobes. We show the evolution of the bay, coastline, delta, and change detection results derived from Landsat satellite images recorded in 1973, 1989, 1999, 2000 and 2003, respectively. Results indicate that sedimentary transport and suspension in Bombetoka Bay has significantly changed during the past 30 years, with a dramatic increase in the amount of sediment moved by the river, and deposited in the estuary and in offshore delta lobes. These changes have adversely affected agriculture, fisheries, and transportation for one of Madagascar's largest ports. The changes are attributed to increased erosion following large-scale deforestation, bush fires, and overgrazing in the river basin.

Mesoscale Variability along the East Coast of India in Spring as Revealed from Satellite Data and OGCM Simulations	JOURNAL OF OCEANOGRAPHY												Since mesoscale features like meanders have great importance in nourishing the coastal fisheries, satellite data analyses and a numerical modeling study were carried out for the east coast of India during spring inter-monsoon time (March-May), when biological productivity is high. During this time, the East India Coastal Current (EICC) system appears as a northward flowing western boundary current of a seasonal subtropical gyre in the Bay of Bengal prior to the summer monsoon with a more intense upwelling in the coastal region. A relatively clear sky permits satellite remote sensing of Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), whose patterns were verified against geostrophic velocity in altimeter data: i.e., phytoplankton grows in colder and nutrient richer water bounded by the seaward meanders. Progression of meanders in the coastal current was revealed and compared with an eddy-resolving Ocean General Circulation Model (OGCM), which is capable of modeling wind-driven general circulation and each stage of the meander growth. The numerical solutions provided the following results, in reasonable agreement with the linear stability theory using a two-and-a-half layer quasi-geostrophic model. Baroclinic instability plays a key role for the meander growth and eddy generation, while meanders in the coastal current are initiated by isolated mesoscale rotations propagating westward. The baroclinically unstable meanders have a wavelength of 500 similar to 700 km, grow in one month and propagate downstream of the coastal current at several kilometers per day. The instability is not strong enough for the meanders to detach an eddy from the western boundary current.																	0916-8370	1573-868X				APR	2010	66	2					273	289		10.1007/s10872-010-0024-x								WOS:000274902400011						
J	Ma, YY; Li, GX				Ma Yanyan; Li Guangxue			Evolution history and trend of the modern Huanghe River Delta	ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA												The evolvement history of modern Huanghe River Delta tidal flat, coastline and underwater terrain were studied based on the analysis of remote sensing images and water depth data. Based on the analysis of seafloor terrain evolution on different historical stages, a formula simulating the erosion and deposition evolvement model of subaqueous Huanghe River Delta slope was proposed, and the evolvement trend of the subaqueous delta terrain was predicted. The result shows that the equilibrium transition zone is near the water depth of 12 m with seabed erosion in shallower water and accumulation in deeper water during the first 150 a after the river channel was deserted. In the meantime, the underwater slope became gentler and the coastal erosion rate became slow gradually. Then, the subaqueous delta slope changed to up concave from upper convex, and the shape of subaqueous delta disappeared. The coast type changed to silt-mud coast about 100-150 a after the river course was deserted. The erosion depth in the foot of the seawall is calculated based on the formula.																	0253-505X					MAR	2010	29	2					40	52		10.1007/s13131-010-0020-4								WOS:000277095000005

Spatial distribution and habitat selection of Barrow's and Common goldeneyes wintering in the St. Lawrence marine system	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE ZOOLOGIE												Our study addresses winter spatial distribution of Barrow's Goldeneyes (Bucephala islandica (Gmelin, 1789)) and Common Goldeneyes (Bucephala clangula (L.. 1758)) at the scale of the St. Lawrence marine system (estuary and northwestern gulf), eastern Canada. Our objectives were (i) to identify and compare the physical factors that control their distributions, (ii) to quantify the level of sympatry between the two species, and (iii) to compare their distribution patterns. We analyzed large-scale synoptic views of winter distribution of both goldeneye species obtained through helicopter-borne surveys. Habitat description was obtained through spatial analyses and remote sensing. Both species showed strong preference for the tidal zone and river mouths. A multiscale analysis showed a decreasing level of sympatry as spatial resolution was refined. The distribution of the Barrow's Goldeneye was more clustered compared with that of the Common Goldeneye, and Barrow's Goldeneye was repeatedly observed in the same few areas. A use-availability analysis identified the northern coast of the St. Lawrence estuary as the main wintering ground for Barrow's Goldeneye in eastern North America.																	0008-4301					MAR	2010	88	3					306	314		10.1139/Z09-144								WOS:000276484900009

Even though there has been progress recently, there is still a great deal of research needed to gain a better understanding of seagrass. In this article we review and discuss the advances in seagrass research in China from two aspects: (1) seagrass species and their distribution; (2) seagrass research in China, including studies on their taxonomy, ecology, photosynthesis, applications in aquaculture, salt-tolerance mechanisms and other research topics. A total of 18 seagrass species belonging to 8 genera are distributed in nine provinces and regions in China (including Hong Kong and Taiwan), as well as the Xisha and Nansha Archipelagos. They can be divided into two groups: a North China Group and a South China Group. Based on the seagrass distribution, the Chinese mainland coast can be divided into three sections: North China Seagrass Coast, Middle China Seagrass Coast, and South China Seagrass Coast. Ecological studies include research on seagrass communities, nutrient cycling in seagrass ecosystems, genetic diversity, pollution ecology and research in the key regions of Shandong, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hainan. Seagrass species and their locations, community structure, ecological evaluation, epiphytes, ecological functions and threats in the key regions are also summarized. Other studies have focused on remote sensing of seagrass, threatened seagrass species of China, and pollen morphology of Halophila ovalis.																	0254-4059					MAR	2010	28	2					329	339		10.1007/s00343-010-9183-2								WOS:000275781400019						
J	Yu, X; Shao, HB; Liu, XH; Zhao, DZ				Yu, Xiang; Shao, Hong-bo; Liu, Xiang-hua; Zhao, Dong-zhi			Applying Neural Network Classification to Obtain Mangrove Landscape Characteristics for Monitoring the Travel Environment Quality on the Beihai Coast of Guangxi, P. R. China	CLEAN-SOIL AIR WATER												The spectral characteristics of mangroves on the Beihai Coast of Guangxi, P. R. China are acquired on the basis of spectral data from field measurements. Following this, the 3-layer reverse-conversing neural networks (NN) classification technology is used to analyze the Landsat TM5 image obtained on January 8, 2003. It is detailed enough to facilitate the introduction of the algorithm principle and trains project of the neural network. Neural network algorithms have characteristics including large-scale data handling and distributing information storage. This research firstly analyzes the necessity and complexity of this translation system, and then introduces the strong points of the neural network. Processing mangrove landscape characteristics by using neural network is an important innovation, with great theoretical and practical significance. This kind of neural network can greatly improve the classification accuracy. The spatial resolution of Landsat TM5 is high enough to facilitate the research, and the false color composite from 3-, 4-, and 5-bands has a clear boundary and provides a significant quantity of information and effective images. On the basis of a field survey, the exported layers are defined as mangrove, vegetation, bare land, wetlands and shrimp pool. TM satellite images are applied to false color composites by using 3-, 4-, and 5-bands, and then a supervised classification model is used to classify the image. The processing method of hyper-spectrum remote sensing allows the spectral characteristics of the mangrove to be determined, and integrates the result with the NN classification for the false color composite by using 3-, 4-, and 5-bands. The network model consists of three layers, i.e., the input layer, the hidden layer, and the output layer. The input layer number of classification is defined as 3, and the hidden layers are defined as 5 according to the function operation. The control threshold is 0.9. The training ratio is 0.2. The maximum permit error is 0.08. The classification precision reaches 86.86%. This is higher than the precision of maximal parallel classification (50.79%) and the spectrum angle classification (75.39%). The results include the uniformity ratio (1.7789), the assembly ratio (0.6854), the dominance ratio ( - 1.5850), and the fragmentation ratio (0.0325).

A series of about 70 European Remote Sensing Satellites SAR images of the German Bight taken at different water levels within four years is analyzed to detect the borderline between tidal flats and adjacent water areas using a wavelet-based edge-detection algorithm. After geocoding, the waterlines are combined with the corresponding water levels to represent the topography on an irregularly spaced grid. The water levels are taken from a numerical tide model and corrected with the measured gauge data. Interpolation of these data into a regular grid yields a topographic map of the intertidal zone. While the general practicability of this method has been demonstrated in previous studies for smaller test areas, this paper is the first attempt to generate maps of a large area on a yearly basis.

The Ministry of Culture and Tourism declared this area a tourism development region in 2005; thus, major investments and developments are already planned. This may negatively impact the surrounding ecologically important ecosystems in the study area. Understanding and monitoring Didim's development is necessary to guide the ministry in promoting sustainable planning and management, as well as mitigating the adverse effects on the ecosystems. The present work aims to detect land use and cover changes of the Didim Peninsula between 1994 and 2005 by using satellite images and remote sensing and geographic information system technologies. Orthorectified Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (2005) and Spot 2X (1994) images are used in the object-oriented classification. The main analytical procedures include image preprocessing, image classification, accuracy assessment, postclassification change detection, and normalized difference vegetation index analyses. Results show three distinct processes taking place in the study area: expansion of artificial surfaces and arable lands; ongoing succession of the vegetation cover, mainly in the central and southwest areas; and transformation from a dense and vigorous vegetation cover to a less dense and sometimes discontinuous vegetation cover, mainly in the east and northeast. Identified trends may have significant consequences in terms of the response that ecosystems give to these changes. A strategy to promote sustainable land use management should be generated timely manner.

Spatial analysis of anthropogenic disturbances in mangrove forests of Bhitarkanika Conservation Area, India	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												The dependence of coastal communities on mangrove forests for direct consumptive use due to the scarcity of alternate resources makes them one of the highly disturbed landscapes. This paper examines the spatial characteristics and extent of anthropogenic disturbances affecting the mangrove forests of Bhitarkanika Conservation Area situated along the east coast of India by using remotely sensed data and GIS, supplemented with socioeconomic surveys. The study reveals that resource extractions from these forests were considerable despite the protected status. Around 14% of the total fuel wood consumed annually in each of the household came from the mangrove forests of the Park. The patterns of consumption were spatially heterogeneous, controlled by the availability of alternatives, ease of accessibility, presence of markets, human density, and forest composition. The disturbance surface showed 30% of the major forest classes to be under high to very high levels of disturbance especially at easy access points. Besides, the distribution of economically useful species also determined the degree of disturbance. Resource use surfaces clearly identified the biotic pressure zones with respect to specific mangrove use and could be combined with the disturbance regime map to prioritize areas for mangrove restoration.																	0255-660X					MAR	2010	38	1					67	83		10.1007/s12524-010-0013-y								WOS:000281393500007						
J	Pereira, AJ; Pezza, AB; Simmonds, I; Lima, RS; Vianna, M				Pereira Filho, Augusto Jose; Pezza, Alexandre Bernardes; Simmonds, Ian; Lima, Raquel Silva; Vianna, Marcio			New perspectives on the synoptic and mesoscale structure of Hurricane Catarina	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH												This work explores in detail synoptic and mesoscale features of Hurricane Catarina during its life cycle from a decaying baroclinic wave to a tropical depression that underwent tropical transition (TT) and finally to a Category 2 hurricane at landfall over Santa Catarina State coast, southern Brazil. This unique system caused 11 deaths mostly off the Brazilian coast and an estimated half billion dollars in damage in a matter of a few hours on 28 March 2004. Although the closest meteorological station available was tens of kilometres away from the eye, in situ meteorological measurements provided by a work-team sent to the area where the eye made landfall unequivocally reproduces the tropical signature with category 2 strength, adding to previous analysis where this data was not available. Further analyses are based mostly on remote sensing data available at the time of the event. A classic dipole blocking set synoptic conditions for Hurricane Catarina to develop, dynamically contributing to the low wind shear observed. On the other hand, on its westward transit, large scale subsidence limited its strength and vertical development. Catarina had relatively cool SST conditions, but this was mitigated by favourable air-sea fluxes leading to latent heat release-driven processes during the mature phase. The ocean's dynamic topography also suggested the presence of nearby warm core rings which may have facilitated the transition and post-transition intensification. Since there were no records of such a system at least in the past 30 years and given that SSTs were generally below 26 degrees C and vertical shear was usually strong, despite all satellite data available, the system was initially classified as an extratropical cyclone. Here we hypothesise that this categorization was based oil inadequate regional scale model outputs which did not account for the importance of the latent heat fluxes over the ocean. Hurricane Catarina represents a dramatic event on weather systems in South America. It has attracted attention worldwide and poses questions as whether or not it is a symptom of global warming.

Definition of a comprehensive set of texture semivariogram features and their evaluation for object-oriented image classification	COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES												In this paper, a comprehensive set of texture features extracted from the experimental semivariogram of specific image objects is proposed and described, and their usefulness for land use classification of high resolution images is evaluated. Fourteen features are defined and categorized into three different groups, according to the location of their respective parameters in the semivariogram curve: (i) features that use parameters close to the origin of the semivariogram, (ii) the parameters employed extend to the first maximum. and (iii) the parameters employed are extracted from the first to the second maximum. A selection of the most relevant features has been performed, combining the analysis and interpretation of redundancies, and using statistical discriminant analysis methods. The suitability of the proposed features for object-based image classification has been evaluated using digital aerial images from an agricultural area on the Mediterranean coast of Spain. The performance of the selected semivariogram features has been compared with two different sets of texture features: those derived from the grey level co-occurrence matrix, and the values of raw semivariance directly extracted from the semivariogram at different positions. As a result of the tests, the classification accuracies obtained using the proposed semivariogram features are, in general, higher and more balanced than those obtained using the other two sets of standard texture features.

The investigated area with 394 measured locations is located along the northern coast of the Nile Delta between Alexandria and ElTina plain in Sinai peninsula exactly between 29 degrees 20' and 32 degrees 40'E and 29 degrees 54' and 31 degrees 35'N with the minimum erosion values of 1.11 m(2), maximum of 6,044,951.64 m(2) and total of 16.02 km(2). On the other hand, 177 sites showed minimum accretion values of 0.05 m(2), maximum of 2,876,855.86 m(2) and total of 13.19 km(2). SLR was determined by applying the quadrant equation for 10-year intervals using 1990 as the base year. Mediterranean SLR along the Nile Delta coast could be estimated considering three different scenarios (low 0.20 m, medium 0.50 m, and high 0.90 m). Impacts of SLR are divided into (1) primary and (2) secondary impacts. Over the coming decades, the Nile Delta will face greater threat due to SLR and land subsidence as well. Regarding climate change and its impacts on soil characteristics, rapid increase in salinity values during the former three decades were found. This increase may be due to the intrusion of salty water of the Mediterranean. On the other hand, organic matter content decreased due to higher temperature, especially during the summer season. Some protection measures were assessed and suggested to combat or tackle SLR.																	1866-6280					FEB	2010	59	7					1497	1506		10.1007/s12665-009-0135-0								WOS:000274182000011

The all-weather capabilities of SARs have attracted significant interest in remote sensing communities, since serious environmental disasters such as oil spills have been highly "elusive" to optical sensors, making visible spectrum data vulnerable to rapidly changing atmospheric conditions. In this paper, we discuss the technical functionalities of TerraSAR-X from the emergency response perspective, describing its technical abilities in terms of a damping ratio, radiometric accuracy, and noise level with reference to the actual Hebei Spirit oil-spill incident that occurred on the west coast of the Korean peninsula in December 2007. The damping ratios estimated from the TerraSAR-X data as a function of Bragg wavenumber for various wind speeds indicate that TerraSAR-X data can be effectively used to identify oil-spill areas with acceptable accuracy. We also received ERS-2, ENVISAT, RADARSAT-1, and ALOS PALSAR data for this oil-spill event, not simultaneously but with varying time delays. The processing results for the multitemporal data sets obtained from the X- and C-band SAR systems are useful since they can be used to determine the near-real-time migration of spilt oil. The results of the current study indicate that there are distinct advantages of using X-band TerraSAR-X data for oil-spill detection compared to the data obtained at other available frequencies.

J	Alpers, W; Chen, JP; Pi, CJ; Lin, II				Alpers, Werner; Chen, Jen-Ping; Pi, Chia-Jung; Lin, I. -I			On the Origin of Atmospheric Frontal Lines off the East Coast of Taiwan Observed on Spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar Images	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												Frontal lines having offshore distances typically between 40 and 80 km are often visible on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images acquired over the east coast of Taiwan by the European Remote Sensing Satellites 1 and 2 (ERS-1 and ERS-2) and Envisat. In a previous paper the authors showed that they are of atmospheric and not of oceanic origin; however, in that paper they did not give a definite answer to the question of which physical mechanism causes them. In this paper the authors present simulations carried out with the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University-National Center for Atmospheric Research Mesoscale Model, which shows that the frontal lines are associated with a quasi-stationary low-level convergence zone generated by the dynamic interaction of onshore airflow of the synoptic-scale wind with the coastal mountain range of the island of Taiwan. Reversed airflow collides with the onshore-flowing air leading to an uplift of air, which is often accompanied by the formation of bands of increased cloud density and of rainbands. The physical mechanism causing the generation of the frontal lines is similar to the one responsible for the formation of cloud bands off the Island of Hawaii as described by Smolarkiewicz et al. Four SAR images are shown, one acquired by ERS-2 and three by Envisat, showing frontal lines at the east coast of Taiwan caused by this generation mechanism. For these events the recirculation pattern, as well as the frontal (or convective) lines observed, were reproduced quite well with the meteorological model. SO, it is argued that the observed frontal lines are not seaward boundaries of (classical) barrier jets or of katabatic wind fields, which have characteristics that are quite different from the flow patterns around the cast coast of Taiwan as indicated by the SAR images.

Detection of a buoyant coastal wastewater discharge using airborne hyperspectral and infrared imagery	JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING												Municipal wastewater discharged into the ocean through a submerged pipe, or outfall, can rise buoyantly to the sea surface, resulting in a near-field mixing zone and, in the presence of an ambient ocean current, an extended surface plume. In this paper, data from a CASI (Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager) and an airborne infrared (IR) camera are shown to detect a municipal wastewater discharge off the southeast coast of Florida, U. S. A., through its elevated levels of chromophoric dissolved organic matter plus detrital material (CDOM) and cooler sea surface temperatures. CDOM levels within a similar to 15-m-diameter surface 'boil' are found to be about twice those in the ambient shelf water, and surface temperatures near the boil are lower by similar to 0.4 degrees C, comparable to the vertical temperature difference across the ambient water column. The CASI and IR imagery show a nearly identically shaped buoyant plume, consistent with a fully surfacing discharge, but the IR data more accurately delineate the area of most rapid dilution as compared with previous in-situ measurements. The imagery also allows identification of ambient oceanographic processes that affect dispersion and transport in the far field. This includes an alongshore front, which limits offshore dispersion of the discharge, and shoreward-propagating nonlinear internal waves, which may be responsible for an enhanced onshore transport of the discharge.

J	Wang, ZY; Gao, S; Huang, HJ				Wang Zhenyan; Gao Shu; Huang Haijun			Spatial variations of tidal water level and their impact on the exposure patterns of tidal land on the central Jiangsu coast	ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA												The exposed area of intertidal zone varies with tidal water level changes. If intercomparisons of satellite images are adopted as a method to determine geomorphological changes of the intertidal zone in response to accretion or erosion processes, then the effect of water level variations must be evaluated. In this study, two Landsat TM images overpassing the central Jiangsu coastal waters on 2 January and 7 March 2002, respectively, were treated by the changing detection analysis using Image Differencing and Post-classification Comparison. The simultaneous tide level data from four tide gauge stations along the coast were used for displaying the spatial variations of water levels and determining the elevations of waterlines. The results show that the spatial variations of water levels are highly significant in the central Jiangsu coastal waters. The huge differences of tidal land exposure patterns between the two imaging times are related mainly to the spatial variations of tidal water levels, which are controlled by the differences in tidal phases for different imaging times and the spatial variations of water level over the study area at each imaging time. Under complex tidal conditions, e.g., those of the central Jiangsu coastal waters, the tide-surge model should be used to eliminate effectively the effects of water level variations on remote sensing interpretation of geomorphological changes in the intertidal zone.																	0253-505X					JAN	2010	29	1					79	87		10.1007/s13131-010-0010-6								WOS:000275535100010

Broad-scale distribution patterns of sardine and their predators in relation to remotely sensed environmental conditions during the KwaZulu-Natal sardine run	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												The annual movement of South African sardine Sardinops sagax up the east coast of South Africa, known as the 'sardine run', was investigated using data from aerial surveys for the period 1988-2005 and compared with remotely sensed sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll a data. Sardine sighting rates were highest within the Waterfall Bluff Bight off the Eastern Cape Coast, where conditions appeared to be most favourable. Sardine and predator sightings decreased significantly northwards of Mdoni on the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) coast, whereas the proportion of nearshore sightings increased. The causal mechanism for this inshore concentration is suggested to be the influx of warm Agulhas Current water from the Durban Eddy that forces sardine shoreward. Cape gannet Morus capensis, common dolphin Delphinus capensis and sardine distributions were associated, and there was an association between SST and sardine and predator distributions. There was a marked increase in bottlenose dolphin Tursiops aduncus sightings upon commencement of the sardine run, with these dolphins being considered to be a 'migratory' stock that enters KZN waters every winter.

J	Gopinath, G				Gopinath, Girish			Critical coastal issues of Sagar Island, east coast of India	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Sagar Island, situated in the east coast of India and one of the biggest deltas in Sundarban group, faces coastal erosion and degradation of coastal vegetation and various natural hazards. Erosion is mainly due to clay mining, wave activities, and the impact of river and tidal currents of Muri Ganga and Hugly Rivers. Further, the coastal zone of Sagar Island faces increasingly severe problems of rapidly growing human population, deteriorating environmental quality, and loss of critical habitats. Sagar Island has been victimized several times by tropical cyclones and influenced daily by tidal fluctuations. The island needs immediate attention on the coastal zone in order to protect the shoreline and ecosystem. The capability of satellite remote sensing to provide synoptic, repetitive, and multispectral data has proved to be very useful in the inventory and monitoring of critical coastal issues. Sagar Island and its environs are subjected to both natural and anthropogenic activities that continuously modify the region.

Erosional processes in the hard rock coastal cliffs at Staithes, North Yorkshire	GEOMORPHOLOGY					International-Association-of-Geomorphologists Regional Conference	JUL, 2007	Kota Kinabalu, MALAYSIA	Int Assoc Geomorphol Reg				The processes of change on near-vertical coastal cliffs have been quantified using terrestrial photogrammetry and laser scanning. The approach allows discrete rockfall geometry to be measured, and source located in three dimensions. This paper presents the analysis of an inventory of over 100000 discrete rockfalls, recorded from the Liassic coast at Staithes, North Yorkshire (UK), where a rock face area of over 16000 m(2) has been monitored over a 20 month period. The data obtained on three-dimensional scar geometry and source position give an insight into rockfall characteristics from a range of rock types, cliff heights and geometries. Multiple failure mechanisms such as overhang collapse, constant spalling, fragmentation and large scale, coherent rockfalls have been observed and related to rock-type controlled processes on the rock face. The spatially referenced rockfall scar data are used to assess the influence of environmental controls on variable rock mass properties, such as rock type, structure and cliff geometry. Analysis of rockfall magnitude-frequency reveals notable similarities between coastal rockfalls and inventories from non-coastal environments. The resolution of the monitoring data allows quantification of rockfalls down to volumes of 1.25 x 10(-4) m(3) to be consistently sampled and measured. This complete magnitude-frequency relationship suggests that rather than evolving exclusively through isolated, sporadic losses, coastal cliff geomorphology reflects interconnected processes in which each rockfall is part of a continuum of change to the rock face. Further detailed assessment of the rock face reveals the control of the pre-failure morphology on subsequent failure patterns, for example, the quantity of rock protrusion from the cliff is positively correlated with subsequent failure volume. The continuum of activity and the controls on failure identified within these data suggest that the episodic behaviour of coastal cliffs previously assumed may have been overstated by coarser resolution monitoring data. The findings improve our understanding of the evolution of coastal cliffs and highlight areas for further research into both cliff processes and the character of rock slope failures in general.

J	Kumari, B; Raman, M				Kumari, Beena; Raman, Mini			Whale shark habitat assessments in the northeastern Arabian Sea using satellite remote sensing	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												One of the major requirements for the growing whale shark tourism industry is to identify potential areas of their aggregation for sighting. This would require baseline information on the occurrence of whale shark and the associated environment. In this context, the relationship between whale shark landings, phytoplankton concentration and sea surface temperature (SST) in the continental shelf and offshore regions of Gujarat coast were examined using satellite data from 1998 to 2000. Monthly images of chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration, an index of phytoplankton biomass and SST were derived for the eastern Arabian Sea from the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) and National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration-Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (NOAA-AVHRR), respectively. Whale sharks (Rhincodon typus) landing data were obtained from a survey conducted by Trade Records Analysis of Flora and Fauna In Commerce (Traffic)-India of the World Wide Fund (WWF)-India and the Central Institute of Fisheries Technology (CIFT), India. Mean chl-a concentration in the study area (between 20-22 degrees N and 69-70 degrees E) covering the continental shelf and adjoining offshore region of coast (depth. 25 m) was observed to be significantly higher (4.23 mg m(-3) in February and 3.88 mg m(-3) in March) compared to regions seaward of the study area (mean of 1.51 mg m(-3) for February and 1.16 mg m(-3) for March) and in southern latitudes of the eastern Arabian Sea (mean of 0.27 mg m(-3) for February and 0.23 mg m(-3) for March). The SST in the study area ranged from 23-26 degrees C for February and March, whereas in the southern latitudes, it ranged from 27-29 degrees C. The SST in regions outside the study area was marginally warmer by 0.5 degrees C. A significant relationship between whale shark landings off Gujarat, chl-a concentration and SST was observed. Results presented in this study contribute to the idea that the combined use of ocean colour and SST images are an appropriate tool to identify potential areas of whale shark aggregation for sightings.																	0143-1161						2010	31	2					379	389		10.1080/01431160902893444								WOS:000273646000009

Synergistic application of oceanographic variables from multi-satellite sensors for forecasting potential fishing zones: methodology and validation results	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												This study uses synergistic application of satellite-derived chlorophyll concentration (CC), sea surface temperature (SST) and sea surface wind (SSW) for forecasting potential fishing zones (PFZs). PFZs are validated in near-real time through fishing operations and detailed statistical analysis of fishing operation data. CC and SST images were derived from Indian Remote Sensing Satellite-Ocean Colour Monitor (IRS-OCM) and NOAA-AVHRR, respectively, to delineate the oceanographic features exhibiting different oceanic processes. QuikSCAT/SeaWinds derived sea surface wind vectors were used to understand, quantify and demonstrate the variability of wind-induced water mass flow as well as their impacts on features/oceanographic process. Oceanographic features such as eddies, rings and fronts were found to be shifted according to the speed and direction of the wind. An algorithm was developed to compute water mass transport and feature shift. An improved methodology was developed and demonstrated using these prime variables, which are responsible for fishery resources distribution. PFZ forecasts were generated and validated through near-real-time fishing operations. The fishing operations data were taken from the logbooks of fishing vessels for detailed statistical analysis. On average, 80% of observations were recorded with more yield than monthly mean catch in the respective areas. A paired t-test showed statistically significant results.																	0143-1161						2010	31	3					775	789		10.1080/01431160902897833								WOS:000275877100014

StripMap and ScanSAR scenes were acquired over the Gulf of Tehuantepec on March 2008, coinciding with a strong Tehuano event with a wind speed of about 24 ms-1. Although spatial variability of wind and wave parameters derived from the image analysis was fairly consistent with model data, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)-derived wind speed was generally underestimated by 33%. The wave-retrieval algorithm, contrastingly, performed well enough to show evidence of shoaling and refracting ocean swell close to the shore. Furthermore, spatial evolution of image intensity spectral peaks suggests the presence of wave energy propagating to the SW, closely aligned with the offshore winds. Although further analyses are required, it could be the first time that growing waves in fetch-limited conditions have been detected through SAR remote sensing.																	0143-1161						2010	31	17-18					4933	4955	PII 927347017	10.1080/01431161.2010.485217								WOS:000282579100030

Yet, after over a century of investigations, its place in the history of Florida and the southeastern United States is not well understood. Crystal River is an important example, in terms of world archaeology, of a monumental landscape constructed by complex hunter-gatherer-fishers along the coast of the southeastern United States. Here, we present the results of our remote sensing program at the site. This research includes topographic mapping, a resistance survey, and ground-penetrating radar transects over various architectural components at the site. These data lend insight into the scale and rapidity of landscape modification at the site, as well as information on the location of previous archaeological excavations and modern disturbances. Further, the data illustrate the potential of shallow geophysical survey to the investigations of shell architecture.																	1556-4894						2010	5	1					33	51		10.1080/15564890903249811								WOS:000208274300003

The erosion process is spatially characterized on the west coast of New Caledonia to assess potential sediment inputs in the marine area. This paper describes the methodologies that are used to map soil sensitivity to erosion using remote sensing and a geographic information system tool. A cognitive approach, multi-criteria evaluation model and Universal Soil Loss Equation are implemented. This article compares the relevance of each model in order to spatialize and quantify potential erosion at catchment basin scale. These types of studies provide valuable results for focusing on areas subject to erosion and serve as a decision-making tool for the minimization of lagoon vulnerability to the natural and human dynamics on the level of the catchment basins.

Using remote sensing to assess tsunami-induced impacts on coastal forest ecosystems at the Andaman Sea coast of Thailand	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												The December 2004 tsunami strongly impacted coastal ecosystems along the Andaman Sea coast of Thailand. In this paper tsunami-induced damage of five different coastal forest ecosystems at the Phang-Nga province coast is analysed with a remote sensing driven approach based on multi-date IKONOS imagery. Two change detection algorithms, change vector analysis (CVA) and direct multi-date classification (DMC), are applied and compared regarding their applicability to assess tsunami impacts. The analysis shows that DMC outperforms CVA in terms of accuracy (Kappa values for DMC ranging between 0.947 and 0.950 and between 0.610-0.730 for CVA respectively) and the degree of detail of the created change classes. Results from DMC show that mangroves were the worst damaged among the five forests, with a 55% of directly damaged forest in the study area, followed by casuarina forest and coconut plantation. Additionally this study points out the uncertainties in both methods which are mainly due to a lack of ground truth information for the time between the two acquisition dates of satellite images. The created damage maps help to better understand the way the tsunami impacted coastal forests and give basic information for estimating tsunami sensitivity of coastal forests.																	1561-8633						2010	10	4					729	745		10.5194/nhess-10-729-2010								WOS:000277185000012

PATAGONIAN SALT MARSHES: THE SOIL EFFECTS ON THE NDVI RESPONSE	THALASSAS												Patagonian and Fueguian salt marshes extend from 39 to 55 degrees S with different tidal and climatic effects. These effects conditioned their behaviour, and remote sensing is a useful tool to analyse these latitudinal trends, being the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) the most common parameter recommended. One of the most difficult issue is to recognize the cord grass (Spartina) from the Sarcocornia plains. Both plants have similar response to the near infrared (NIR) and red bands although Spartina can cover entirely the tidal flat only when it is tall enough. In the semiarid Patagonia, NDVI should be adjusted to soil effects in order to evaluate marsh distribution. However, marshes do not cover entirely the tidal flats and there are differences that could be envisaged to the sediment composition of these flats but also to the silting capacity of these plants.

Spill areas were classified based on their chemical composition and were extracted from satellite images supported with field surveys. Maps of the topography, land cover were constructed from the spatial data sets in GIS. Bathymetry map, shoreline sensitivity, socioeconomic, biological, wind and sea current data were extracted from various resources and modeled in GIS,for oil spill trajectory simulation analysis. An oil spill simulation model was developed as a way to find the suitable solution for emergency response and management in case of any, future spill occurs in the study area. Remote sensing, GIS and other geomatic systems can be employed to mitigate the age-old problems of information availability and timeliness, data management and synoptic inventory of natural resources when an oil spill caused by accident or human error. This paper describes application of remote sensing and GIS for detecting, mapping, evaluating and modeling of spills in sea environments in order to reduce responding time and qualify the decision making process in contingency planning.

Surface Signature of the Chesapeake Bay Outflow Variability Observed with Coastal Radar	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												The present work is an observational analysis of the small-scale variations induced by Chesapeake Bay outflow on coastal surface circulation off Virginia. The variation in freshwater discharge into Chesapeake Bay is investigated as a triggering mechanism for local coastal jets. While it is known that an extra amount of freshwater received from the tributaries will lead to an increased total outflow, the effect on the outflow surface signature (the upper meter) has not been extensively explored. Our analysis is based on surface currents, wind data, and freshwater discharge records. The surface currents were derived from two high-frequency Doppler radars deployed on the Virginia coast during September and October 1996 and 1997. The wind data were obtained from a nearby weather Coastal-Marine Automated Network station, and the freshwater discharge data were from the U.S. Geological Survey stations located at the mouth of each tributary. The freshwater discharge into the bay observed during 1996 decreased from 4200 to 1000 m(3)/s in 10 days, while for the 1997 period it varied between 500 and 5500 m(3)/s in 1 week. The present analysis shows that sudden variations of freshwater flux will drive the plume further offshore before its normal southward turning, in the same way upwelling-favorable winds do as reported in all the available literature of the area. Strong freshwater variations on weekly scales are then shown to be an important factor in deter-mining the extent of the surface plume displacement and the fate of the shelf currents or jets.

Eddies and filaments of the Western Adriatic Current near Cape Gargano: Analysis and prediction	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												Remote sensing and in situ observations, and model simulations made during the Dynamics of the Adriatic in Real Time (DART) project in the central Adriatic Sea during 2006 reveal intense mesoscale eddy activity in the West Adriatic Current (WAC) system, that flows along the Italian coast. We investigate the origin, scale and rate of evolution of these features, and consider their potential contributions to across-shelf exchange, as a basis for planning future operational coastal prediction and monitoring programs. Predictions from a regional Adriatic Sea implementation of the Navy Coastal Ocean Model (NCOM) are assessed using observations from satellites, current meter moorings, and ship hydrographic transects. Near Cape Gargano in summer, mesoscale eddies and filaments observed in remote sensing imagery and in situ data exhibit horizontal and vertical scales of about 30 km and 25 m, respectively. The observed eddies develop along the WAC front under transient wind conditions, while a quasi-permanent anti-cyclonic circulation appears downstream of the cape. NCOM model predictions show that well-organized, multiple-eddy features appear, grow in unison, then dissipate along the coast West of Cape Gargano in response to transient along-shelf wind forcing, while east of it individual eddies are generated by interaction of the WAC main stream with the bathymetry surrounding the cape. The eddies evolve over time scales of a few days to a week in response to forcing transients. Moderate to strong northwest winds compress the WAC coastward and suppress the instabilities, while relaxing northwest winds or shifts to southeast winds expand the WAC and enhance instability growth. Together with entrained filaments of coastal water, the eddies translate, stretch and rotate in response to WAC horizontal advection and shear. The qualitative character and evolution of the modeled features agree with the observations, and model statistics reveal patterns of variability on monthly and seasonal time scales that are consistent with the appearance of individual eddies in both the model results and observations. In the model, patterns of upwelling and downwelling associated with the WAC main stream and eddies may be linked to dynamical characteristics of the WAC flow and specific bathymetric features. Under wintertime conditions, theoretical arguments predict an upwelling response as flow divergence changes absolute vorticity where the WAC rounds the cape, while Ekman pumping driven by surface winds or bottom stress and associated secondary circulation could explain upwelling and downwelling patches appearing around the rims of individual eddies. The upwelling dynamics are complicated by seasonal stratification effects and bathymetric features, and more work is needed to elucidate these processes. Based on their frequent occurrence, large size compared to the shelf width, high intensity and current shear, and secondary circulations, the eddies and filaments could contribute significantly to across-shelf exchange and coastal/deep-ocean mixing, with important implications for coastal monitoring and prediction. Their generation and evolution present special challenges for coastal prediction, but our results demonstrate that combined use of remote sensing imagery and numerical model simulations can yield valuable insight into such processes, and thereby help plan future monitoring and prediction efforts.

An evaluation of a high-resolution operational wave forecasting system in the Adriatic Sea	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												The SWAN (Simulating Waves Nearshore) wave model using wind inputs generated by the ALADIN 8-km, operational high-resolution, atmospheric model was run in real-time to provide surface waves forecast for the semi-enclosed Adriatic Sea in support of the "Dynamics of the Adriatic in Real-Time" (DART) field experiments. Together with predictions from other wave and wind models, the successful prediction of a high sea-state event by this model led to a real-time shifting of planned operations while at sea, allowing five ADCP moorings to be deployed just before a bora storm and associated storm waves arrived. The model was also able to simulate the spatial gradients in significant wave height observed by in-situ and remote-sensing measurements for a particular sirocco storm case study, providing an additional perspective in aiding interpretation of the model output of features. To further quantify prediction skill, the wave forecast performance over a 12-month period was evaluated against in-situ and altimeter measurements over the region. Correlation coefficients between forecast and in-situ measured significant wave heights were from 0.82 to 0.91 for the 24-h forecast and from 0.78 to 0.88 for the 48-h forecast. However, best-fit slope comparisons with in-situ wave data at five coastal locations show the forecast wave heights were underpredicted by 10% to 30%. Best-fit slope comparisons between modeled wind speeds, U(10), and significant wave heights, H(s), and altimeter-derived measurements show that model U(10) was about 4% underpredicted, but H(s) was underpredicted by an average of 30%. The underprediction of SWAN H(s) has a very significant location-dependent geographical variation ranging from 10% to over 50%. In addition, the wave model comparison with altimeter H(s) shows a broad region of scatter index exceeding 0.4 along and offshore of the central Croatian coast. Elsewhere the scatter index is generally around 0.3. Compared to previous studies we found that using higher-resolution wind forcing with realistic orography decreased the U(10) underestimation bias, but the magnitude of H(s) underestimation bias did not correspondingly decrease, suggesting that wave model dynamics or wind-wave Coupling deserves further investigation.

It is therefore still unclear how light climate shapes spatio-temporal patterns in near-coast chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration. In order to identify an effective representation of light extinction due to suspended particulate matter (SPM) in ecosystem models, we integrate different formulations of light attenuation into a coupled physical-biological model of the German Bight. The model describes Chl-a as well as phytoplankton-zooplankton interactions and calculates physical transport using the General Estuarine Transport Model (GETM). Parameters of the ecosystem module were calibrated using a OD setup constrained by available measurements at Helgoland Roads. The comparison between data and simulations shows that the model, despite its simplicity, is capable of reproducing the development of the spring bloom in 2003. We propose a novel application that uses MERIS-derived spatial data to constrain the parameterisation of light extinction and compare different scenarios of light attenuation as determined by phytoplankton self-shading, yellow substances and SPM dynamics. our work highlights the sensitivity of calculated autotrophic growth to water depth, salinity fronts and sediment transport. We found that the accuracy of SPM-forcing is only critical at the onset of the bloom. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Fleury, JM; Pubellier, M; de Urreiztieta, M				Fleury, Jean-Marc; Pubellier, Manuel; de Urreiztieta, Marc			Structural expression of forearc crust uplift due to subducting asperity	LITHOS												New structural observations and mapping of reefal terraces, carried out both on the field and on satellite remote sensing data, indicate that Sumba Island is presently undergoing a large amount of extension, associated with a significant regional uplift. This crustal uplift may have been created by a major thrust emerging in the South of the island. The uplift which partly accommodated the Australian plate-South West Banda Arc convergence, is associated with the general northeastward tilt of the island. The consequent anomalous positive topography along the southern coast of the island is being compensated by significant tectonic erosion along large-scale curvilinear normal faults in the southeastern half of the island. The most important expression of this gravitational collapse is located at the receding side of an advancing circular dome, showing striking similarities with accretionary wedges being affected by seamount subduction. The part of the forearc basin known as the Savu Basin is moderately deformed (mostly in its central part) and appears to act as a rigid buttress in the convergence between the Banda Arc and the Australian plate. As a result the convergence appears to be transferred northward within the actively-shortening back-arc domain, which goes from the north of the Flores Island to the southwest of the Timor block. The convergent plate boundary shows a transition between a stable domain (West of Sumba) and a tectonized domain (East of Sumba), the latter coinciding with the subduction of the outer Australian passive margin. The subduction of the ocean-continent boundary of the Austral-Indian plate below the Banda arc since the Lower Pliocene may have incorporated some crustal fragments in the plunging Benioff zone. Most likely, the integration of the stretched continental lithosphere in the subduction zone caused the uplift the entire forearc domain, exhibiting inherited structures of the upper plate.

A comprehensive set of optical data was collected during three cruises in June, August, and September 2005 in the Bohai Sea. The vertical profile measurements, such as chlorophyll concentration, water turbidity, downwelling irradiance, and diffuse attenuation coefficient, showed that the Bohai Sea was vertically stratified with a relative clear upper layer superimposed on a turbid lower layer. The upper layer was found to correspond to the euphotic zone and the deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) occurs at the base of this layer. By tuning a semi-analytical model (Lee et al., 1998, 1999) for the Bohai Sea, we developed a method to derive water inherent optical properties and the depth of DCM from above-surface measurements. Assuming a 'fake' bottom in the stratified water, this new method retrieves the 'fake' bottom depth, which is highly correlated with the DCM depth. The average relative error between derived and measured values is 33.9% for phytoplankton absorption at 440 nm, 25.6% for colored detrital matter (detritus plus gelbstoff) absorption at 440 nm, and 24.2% for the DCM depth. This modified method can retrieve water inherent optical properties and monitor the depth of DCM in the Bohai Sea, and the method is also applicable to other stratified waters. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Detecting temporal shoreline changes and erosion/accretion rates, using remote sensing, and their associated sediment characteristics along the coast of North Sinai, Egypt	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY												The variation during 15 years in the shoreline along the North Sinai coast has been determined by analysing TM and ETM true colour Landsat images from 1986 to 2001. The analyses identified erosion and accretion patterns along the coast. The shoreline has advanced west of El Bardawil inlet1, El Bardawil inlet2, and El Arish Harbour, where the wave-induced littoral transport has been halted by jetty construction and beach growth rates are 20,681, 69,855 and 20,160 m(2)/year, respectively. On the downdrift side of the constructed jetties to the east, the shoreline is retreating and beaches erode at rates of -71,710, -69,968, and -11,760 m(2)/year, respectively. Sedimentological analyses of beach sediment samples have indicated selective transport of heavy minerals according to their densities and grain sizes. A general correspondence has been found between variation in grain size, sorting and heavy-mineral content of beach sand and the patterns of shoreline changes.																	0943-0105					OCT	2009	58	7					1419	1427		10.1007/s00254-008-1644-y								WOS:000270302100005

Evaluating the condition of a mangrove forest of the Mexican Pacific based on an estimated leaf area index mapping approach	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Given the alarming global rates of mangrove forest loss it is important that resource managers have access to updated information regarding both the extent and condition of their mangrove forests. Mexican mangroves in particular have been identified as experiencing an exceptional high annual rate of loss. However, conflicting studies, using remote sensing techniques, of the current state of many of these forests may be hindering all efforts to conserve and manage what remains. Focusing on one such system, the Teacapan-Agua Brava-Las Haciendas estuarine-mangrove complex of the Mexican Pacific, an attempt was made to develop a rapid method of mapping the current condition of the mangroves based on estimated LAI. Specifically, using an AccuPAR LP-80 Ceptometer, 300 indirect in situ LAI measurements were taken at various sites within the black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) dominated forests of the northern section of this system. From this sample, 225 measurements were then used to develop linear regression models based on their relationship with corresponding values derived from QuickBird very high resolution optical satellite data. Specifically, regression analyses of the in situ LAI with both the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the simple ration (SR) vegetation index revealed significant positive relationships [LAI versus NDVI (R (2) = 0.63); LAI versus SR (R (2) = 0.68)]. Moreover, using the remaining sample, further examination of standard errors and of an F test of the residual variances indicated little difference between the two models. Based on the NDVI model, a map of estimated mangrove LAI was then created. Excluding the dead mangrove areas (i.e. LAI = 0), which represented 40% of the total 30.4 km(2) of mangrove area identified in the scene, a mean estimated LAI value of 2.71 was recorded. By grouping the healthy fringe mangrove with the healthy riverine mangrove and by grouping the dwarf mangrove together with the poor condition mangrove, mean estimated LAI values of 4.66 and 2.39 were calculated, respectively. Given that the former healthy group only represents 8% of the total mangrove area examined, it is concluded that this mangrove system, considered one of the most important of the Pacific coast of the Americas, is currently experiencing a considerable state of degradation. Furthermore, based on the results of this investigation it is suggested that this approach could provide resource managers and scientists alike with a very rapid and effective method for monitoring the state of remaining mangrove forests of the Mexican Pacific and, possibly, other areas of the tropics.

Comparison of Seafloor Roughness and Scattered Acoustic Temporal Decorrelation	IEEE JOURNAL OF OCEANIC ENGINEERING												Connecting changes in acoustic scattering from the seafloor with changes in seafloor topography is essential for modeling the time dependence of the scattering and the development of acoustics as a tool for the remote sensing of benthic activity. An equation is derived that links the decorrelation of scattered acoustic power with the decorrelation of seafloor roughness spectral estimates. The result is assessed through a comparison of decorrelation values generated by processing topographical data recorded by a digital photogrammetry system and backscattering data acquired with a translating source/receiver assembly. Both data sets were collected off the western coast of Florida as part of the U.S. Office of Naval Research (ONR)-sponsored Sediment Acoustics Experiment (SAX04), during which the primary mechanism of topographical change at the frequencies of interest appeared to be fish feeding. Although decorrelation curves proved to be both space and time dependent, and the collection of data sets was neither collocated nor synchronized, the agreement between averaged topographical and acoustic decorrelation values was reasonable. Both types exhibited a strong frequency dependence, which should prove beneficial in classifying and quantifying sources of seabed transformation if it is mechanism specific.				williams, kevin/H-2224-2011													0364-9059					OCT	2009	34	4					423	430		10.1109/JOE.2008.923550								WOS:000272383800006

An algorithm for oceanic front detection in chlorophyll and SST satellite imagery	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS					American-Geophysical-Union Meeting on Ocean Sciences	FEB 20-24, 2006	Honolulu, HI	Amer Geophys Union				An algorithm is described for oceanic front detection in chlorophyll (Chl) and sea surface temperature (SST) satellite imagery. The algorithm is based on a gradient approach: the main novelty is a shape-preserving, scale-sensitive, contextual median filter applied selectively and iteratively until convergence. This filter has been developed specifically for Chl since these fields have spatial patterns such as chlorophyll enhancement at thermohaline fronts and small- and meso-scale chlorophyll blooms that are not present in SST fields. Linear Chl enhancements and localized (point-wise) blooms are modeled as ridges and peaks respectively, whereas conventional fronts in Chl and SST fields are modeled as steps or ramps. Examples are presented of the algorithm performance using modeled (synthetic) images as well as synoptic Chl and SST imagery. After testing, the algorithm was used on >6000 synoptic images, 1999-2007, to produce climatologies of Chl and SST fronts off the U.S. Northeast. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we evaluate land cover change processes around one of the most important tropical dry forest reserves in the Americas: the Chamela-Cuixmala Biosphere Reserve, Mexico. The analysis is conducted at three scales: regional scale (coast of the State of Jalisco), proximity to the reserve (via a 30-km buffer zone analysis), and inside the Biosphere Reserve. The proximity analysis is complemented by a unique data set that represents the extent and boundaries of Ejidos (local land management units) in the region. Results indicate that areas surrounding the reserve have low deforestation, with Ejidos and buffer areas having more forest cover as they get closer to the reserve. The nature of this important phenomenon is discussed in the context of the socio-economic conditions of the local communities. Our work suggests that the creation of a network of "Ejidos' Conservation Areas", in the context of an approach that will recognize payments for environmental services provided to local communities, could contribute to the conservation and maintenance of the rich biodiversity in a region that has one of the highest levels of endemism in the world.

J	Ohde, T				Ohde, Thomas			Investigation of hydrogen sulphide eruptions along the Namibian coastline using different remote sensing systems	CENTRAL EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												Hydrogen sulphide eruptions with their typical turquoise discolorations at the water surface are a unique phenomenon along the Namibian coastline. The remote sensing techniques of ocean colour sensors and microwave scatterometers were used for the investigation of such events. The studies with ocean colour sensors showed that the turquoise discolorations near the Namibian coast were neither linked to dust deposition into the water column by desert storms nor to the reflection of bright material in shallow water areas. In addition, other coloured marine events like algae blooms and river outflows were differentiable from the hydrogen sulphide eruptions by their special optical properties. Quasi-true colour images and spectral identification methods were utilised to monitor and investigate the spatial and temporal distribution of sulphide events. In the past years, they were sometimes and locally limited discovered. Newest remote sensing observations including our own investigations have established that the occurrence of sulphide events is more frequent and longer lasting. The north-westerly direction of propagation and their velocity between 12 cm s(-1) and 15 cm s(-1) were derived from an event on 14 April 2004. Lastly, the microwave scatterometer remote sensing was applied to investigate the relation of sulphide events to oceanographic conditions. The events from May 2004 were clearly related to strong coastal upwelling.

El-Hammam area is located in the NWCE with an area of 94752 acres and is one of the main challenging regions for sustaianble development. In this study, we have used remote sensing and soil data in combination with GIS tools, for land use sustainable analysis (SLU) in El-Hammam area. The SLU was established based on various factors such as: land capability and suitability, water resources availability, economic return from water and financial return from land and water. A physiographic soil map for the study area was prepared using remote sensing and GIS. Multiple field surveys were carried out for collecting information on various soil map units (SMUs) and their profiles. Laboratory analysis for the collected samples was performed, and then the soil properties were stored as attributes in a geographical soil database linked with the SMUs. Furthermore, land capability assessment was done to define the suitable areas for agricultural production using a capability model built in ALES software. Results indicate that the area currently lacks high capability and moderate capability classes. By improving the soil properties, the soil can attain potential capability; and 55630 acres will become marginally capable. The assessment of soil physical suitability for different land use types (LUTs) were analysed in ALES software, in order to generate the most suitable areas. The results from the land suitability analysis indicated that, 17114 acres are moderately suitable for wheat and sorghum; whereas 15823 acres are moderately suitable for barley and 12752 acres are moderately suitable for maize, olive and figs. Finally, the SLU was investigated based on two scenarios; (1) the most SLU under the conditions of shortage of irrigation water: clover, barley and sorghum against figs, as the irrigation requirements for barley and sorghum are low; (2) the most sustainable land use in the conditions of irrigation availability will be wheat and maize against figs and guava. From the results it is quite evident that GIS combined with modeling approaches are powerful tools for decision making in the study area.

A Method for Compositing Polar MODIS Satellite Images to Remove Cloud Cover for Landfast Sea-Ice Detection	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING												This paper presents details of techniques for generating thermal infrared and visible composite images from the cloud-free portions of temporally closely spaced MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images, with a focus on studies of landfast sea ice along the East Antarctic coast. Composite image inclusion criteria are based on modified MODIS Earth Observing System cloud mask product results. The compositing process presented places emphasis on retaining maximum spatial resolution while minimizing storage space requirements. Composite images can be produced either as a regular product (e. g., on a ten-day grid), or dynamically (whenever enough information is acquired to produce a new output image). The techniques presented are applicable at any latitude, are available for all MODIS channels at their native resolution, can combine Aqua and Terra images, and can produce maps in any output projection. However, due to the polar orbit of NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites which host the MODIS instrument, more frequent coverage is produced at higher latitudes. Thus, the techniques presented are particularly applicable to polar research. Examples of composite image generation of the landfast sea ice around the Mertz Glacier region, East Antarctica, are included for both winter and summer.

Land Use Dynamics in a Marine Protected Area System in Lower Andaman Coast of Thailand, 1990-2005	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												This study has depicted a scenario on assessing spatial and temporal land use/cover changes in and adjacent to marine protected areas (MPA) in a study site in Thailand. The measurement of landscape stability and its implications for protection and conservation of coastal resources are emphasized in this study. The methods employed include interpretation and analysis of satellite images, aerial photographs, and geographic information system (GIS) data. Image analysis and GIS techniques have been used extensively, and a site-specific geospatial database was developed accordingly. Initial temporal changes inside and outside protected areas are captured from visual interpretation of three time series satellite images, where an increase of aquaculture ponds and abandoned areas is clearly visible. The output changes derived from the image differencing techniques demonstrated considerable changes in the whole study area as well as inside the protected area boundary during 1976 to 1990. Compared to the earlier time (1976-1990) the changes during 1990 to 2005 are found to be less extensive. Although the existing marine protected areas were declared earlier than the 1990s, the changes are still found inside the protected area boundary during 1990-2005. The result shows significant increases in agriculture areas, including aquaculture development, which are, however, less inside the protected areas than the buffer areas. While mangrove areas have noticeable negative changes, an increase in Malalueca forest areas is interesting. In the discussion, a quantitative comparison of legislative boundary and buffer effects on protecting land use and land cover is illustrated. In light of existing ecological context and socioeconomic activities, observations are made on agents of change and resource use conflicts.																	0749-0208					SEP	2009	25	5					1082	1095		10.2112/08-1058.1								WOS:000270369500002

Investigations of an intense aerosol loading during 2007 cyclone SIDR - A study using satellite data and ground measurements over Indian region	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Tropical cyclones are prominent weather systems characterized by high atmospheric pressure gradients and wind speeds. Intense tropical cyclones occur in India during the pre-monsoon (spring). early monsoon (early summer), or post-monsoon (fall) periods. Originating in both the Bay of Bengal (BoB) and the Arabian Sea (AS), these tropical cyclones often attain velocities of more than 100 km h(-1) and are notorious for causing intense rain and storm surge as they cross the Indian coast. In this study, we examine the changes in the aerosol properties associated with an intense tropical cyclone "SIDR", that occurred during 11-16 November 2007 over BoB. This cyclone, accompanied with very strong surface winds reaching 223 km h(-1), caused extensive damage over Bangladesh. Ground-based measurements of Aerosol Optical Depth (ADD) in the neighboring urban environment of Hyderabad, India, showed significant variations due to changes in wind velocity and direction associated with the cyclone passage. The Terra-MODIS and AVHRR satellite images showed prevalence of dust particles mixed with emissions from anthropogenic sources and biomass-burning AS, while the aerosol loading over BoB was significantly lower. The positive values of Aerosol index (AI) obtained from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) suggested the presence of an elevated aerosol layer over the West coast of India, AS and Thar Desert during and after the cyclone episode. Meteorological parameters from the MM5 mesoscale model were used to study the variations in winds associated with the cyclonic activity. Particulate matter loading over the region during the cyclone period increased by similar to 45% with an accompanying decrease in columnar aerosol optical depth. The variations in Angstrom parameters suggested coarse-mode particle loading due to dust aerosols as observed in satellite data. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The data were collected in the ZIP-97 experiment in the Baltic Sea. The motion of the sea-ice field on the coast is modelled, using analytic methods, and the cases are classified according to the role played by coastal friction. The relaxation of the ice motion showed two time scales: a short time scale (hours) determined by the local wind and a long time scale (days) resulting from the spin-down of large-scale ice massifs. The Coulomb friction results are independent of the spatial scale, while fracture mechanics models include surface area/contact length as an important scaling factor. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

J	De Waele, J; Melis, MT				De Waele, Jo; Melis, Maria Teresa			Geomorphology and geomorphological heritage of the Ifrane-Azrou region (Middle Atlas, Morocco)	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY												Geomorphological heritage is a widely used term in European and North-American countries, but is still scarcely mentioned in Africa. Nevertheless, the attractiveness of the African countries is often intimately connected to its breathtaking and endless geological landscapes. Morocco is one of those countries that has the widest diversity in landscapes and landforms, ranging from the Mediterranean and Atlantic coasts over the Rif, Middle Atlas, High Atlas and Anti-Atlas mountain chains to the great rocky and sandy deserts in the South. A wide variety of geological units hosting different types of important economic mineral deposits cover a temporal range from Late Precambrian to Quaternary. A detailed geomorphological study has been carried out in the region of Ifrane and Azrou (Middle Atlas, Central Morocco) using a combination of high resolution satellite data and direct field observations integrated by geological maps and scientific literature. In order to describe and evaluate the geomorphological heritage of this area, 40 geomorphosites have been selected comprising springs, karst landforms (polje, dolines, caves, sinkholes, stone forests, cryptokarstic dolines), carbonate depositional landforms (travertines and waterfalls), fluvial landforms (meanders, canyons, palaeo-valleys, etc.), structural landforms (triangular facets, hogbacks, cuestas, residual outcrops, etc.) and volcanic landforms (volcanoes, caldeira, pyroclastic cones, lava tube). The results of this research have been summarised in a thematic map, representing the geomorphosites related to various landscape units.				melis, maria teresa/J-4709-2012; De Waele, Jo/A-7509-2008	melis, maria teresa/0000-0003-0970-1244; De Waele, Jo/0000-0001-5325-5208												0943-0105					AUG	2009	58	3					587	599		10.1007/s00254-008-1533-4								WOS:000267895600014						
J	Shi, W; Wang, MH				Shi, Wei; Wang, Menghua			An assessment of the black ocean pixel assumption for MODIS SWIR bands	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Recent studies show that an atmospheric correction algorithm using shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands improves satellite-derived ocean color products in turbid coastal waters. In this paper, the black pixel assumption (i.e., zero water-leaving radiance contribution) over the ocean for the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) SWIR bands at 1240, 1640, and 2130 run is assessed for various coastal ocean regions. The black pixel assumption is found to be generally valid with the MODIS SWIR bands at 1640 and 2130 nm even for extremely turbid waters. For the MODIS 1240 nm band, however, ocean radiance contribution is generally negligible in mildly turbid waters such as regions along the U.S. east coast, while some slight radiance contributions are observed in extremely turbid waters, e.g., some regions along the China east coast, the estuary of the La Plata River. Particularly, in the Hangzhou Bay, the ocean radiance contribution at the SWIR band 1240 mn results in an overcorrection of atmospheric and surface effects, leading to errors of MODIS-derived normalized water-leaving radiance at the blue reaching similar to 0.5 MW cm(-2) mu m(-1) sr(-1). In addition, we found that, for non-extremely turbid waters, i.e., the ocean contribution at the near-infrared (NIR) band <similar to 1.0 mW cm(-2) mu m(-1) sr(-1), there exists a good relationship in the regional normalized water-leaving radiances between the red and the NIR bands. Thus, for non-extremely turbid waters, such a red-NIR radiance relationship derived regionally can possibly be used for making corrections for the regional NIR ocean contributions without using the SWIR bands, e.g., for atmospheric correction of ocean color products derived from the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS).

Light scattering by particles suspended in the sea: The role of particle size and density	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												Optical scattering and particle size measurements are reported at 78 stations along the south and west coast of Britain. The composition of the particles is mainly mineral (70% by mass on average) and the light scattering per unit concentration of suspended particles, the specific scattering coefficient, was observed to vary by over an order of magnitude, from less than 0.1 to over 1 m(2) g(-1). More than 3/4 of this variance is explained by changes in the apparent density (dry weight/'wet' volume) and mean size of the particles. For this data set, the specific scattering coefficient can be written b*(M) = (2.35/rho D-A) where b*(M) is the scattering coefficient per unit concentration of mineral particles, rho the apparent density and D-A the mean particle diameter by area. The standard error of the numerator in this equation is 0.08. In fact, most (64%) of the variance in b*(M) is explained by differences in the apparent density of the particles, with variations in particle diameter alone accounting for only 15% of the variance. Because particles in coastal waters flocculate into aggregates containing mineral and organic material as well as water, the apparent density of the particles is variable and considerably less than solid mineral material. Provided a suitable atmospheric correction for visible-band imagery over shelf seas can be applied, it may be possible to estimate b* using satellite remote-sensing measurements of reflectance at two wavelengths. This work has shown that maps of b* produced in this way will be sensitive to variations in near-surface particle density as well as size. It may, however, be possible to use site-specific empirical relationships between particle size and density to derive both of these parameters from space. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Monitoring shoreline environment of Paradip, east coast of India using remote sensing	CURRENT SCIENCE												In the present study, we used multi-temporal satellite images of Indian Remote Sensing Satellites (IRS1D and IRS P6 - Resourcesat) from 1998 to 2005 to monitor the coastal environment of Paradip, east coast of India. The resultant coastal vector maps were used to estimate the geomorphological changes and shifting of the shoreline position. This integrated study is found useful for exploring accretion and erosion processes in the region. The shoreline maps were compared with the 1973 Survey of India toposheets to estimate the changes which have occurred in the region. Results indicate an increase of 7.72 km in shoreline length and a net loss of 18.73 km(2) of beach area between the years 1973 and 1998, and 0.46 km reduction in shoreline length and 3.11 km(2) increase in beach area between 1998 and 2005. An overall net increase of 7.26 km length shoreline and a net loss of 15.6 km(2) was observed between 1973 and 2005. The years 2001, 2002 and 2003 exhibited loss in length of shoreline as well as area of the beach. These years coincided with certain coastal activities carried out in the study region.

Analysis of cover change (1995-2005) of Tanzania/Mozambique trans-boundary mangroves using Landsat imagery	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS					5th Western-Indian-Ocean-Marine-Science-Association Symposium (WIOMSA)	OCT 22-26, 2007	Durban, SOUTH AFRICA	Western Indian Ocean Marine Sci Assoc, Oceanog Res Inst				1. Despite the ecological, environmental, and economic importance of mangroves, they are declining at an alarming rate worldwide, mostly as a result of human activities. 2. Along the eastern African coast, Mozambique has the largest mangrove area. Fishing and farming are the main economic activities in the area, and people harvest mangrove vegetation for tannins, fuel wood, traditional medicine, boat-building, carpentry, and crafting. 3. Landsat 5 TM imagery was used to map the distribution of trans-boundary mangrove areas along the Mtwara-Quirimbas Complex. Results for 1995 and 2005 are presented for the entire coastline and in more detail for the Ruvuma estuary, Quiterajo, Ibo/Quirimba islands, and Pemba Bay. Results were validated with a ground-truthing excursion in 2006, showing an overall thematic accuracy of 73%. 4. Total estimated area of mangrove was 357 km(2) in 1995 and 368 km(2) in 2005, with the small net gain of 3% corresponding to a total gain of 32 km(2) and a total loss of 21 km(2) over this decade. 5. Results suggest that although Landsat TM imagery can be effective in mapping mangrove distribution, caution must be used in inferring its ecological condition.

Coastal Validation of Ultra-High Resolution Wind Vector Retrieval From QuikSCAT in the Gulf of Maine	IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS												An experimental 2.5-km ultrahigh-resolution (UHR) wind product provided by NASA's QuikSCAT scatterometer offers the potential for new access to coastal surface wind dynamics at the mesoscale level and below. To give future users the best indication of the value of these data, the UHR wind retrievals must be fully validated in nearshore areas. Comparison with meteorological buoys and standard QuikSCAT products allows detailed investigation of UHR winds. Speed and direction residuals are calculated between all scatterometer products and collocated buoys. An ambiguity selection routine improves wind direction agreement between the UHR winds and the other products. Magnitude residuals follow the patterns of the standard QuikSCAT winds, with a 1-2 m/s positive bias in light winds (below 4 m/s) and high winds (above 16 m/s) and standard deviations consistently below 3 m/s. After application of a land contamination removal algorithm, the UHR product provides extended coverage near the coast. An example of a specific wind event illustrates the potential benefits of improved resolution measurements for examining ocean-atmosphere dynamics.

Quantifying Seasonal Shoreline Variability at Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, Using Automated Imaging Techniques	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												We describe a seven-camera video system deployed at Rehoboth Beach on the Atlantic coast of Delaware that was used to monitor and quantify the evolution of a nourished beach. Shorelines along 6 km of beach were automatically identified using pixel-intensity gradients from time-exposure and variance imagery. Correlations between automatically identified and user-defined shorelines from images with various wave and atmospheric conditions exceed r(2) values of 0.92. Small variations in camera azimuth and tilt were found to significantly affect apparent shoreline locations and were automatically corrected through image-correlation procedures. Hourly shoreline data were tidally and seasonally averaged to quantify seasonal morphodynamic variability. Over a summer-winter-summer monitoring period, the shoreline exhibited erosional and accretional variations of similar to 10 m dependent in the alongshore direction on permanent man-made structures and subject to seasonally characteristic littoral transport variations. A comparison of mean seasonal shoreline locations revealed a mean erosion value of similar to 0.8 m between the summer of 2006 and the summer of 2007; this erosion rate is consistent with previous studies of this area. The temporal history of the planform area, obtained from shoreline position, showed weak correlation with volumetric measurements and thus could not be used as a proxy for volumetric change at this site.																	0749-0208					JUL	2009	25	4					900	914		10.2112/08-1029.1								WOS:000267906700008

Biogenic carbon and anthropogenic pollutants combine to form a cooling haze over the southeastern United States	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Remote sensing data over North America document the ubiquity of secondary aerosols resulting from a combination of primary biogenic and anthropogenic emissions. The spatial and temporal distribution of aerosol optical thickness (AOT) over the southeastern United States cannot be explained by anthropogenic aerosols alone, but is consistent with the spatial distribution, seasonal distribution, and temperature dependence of natural biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions. These patterns, together with observations of organic aerosol in this region being dominated by modern C-14 and BVOC oxidation products with summer maxima, indicate nonfossil fuel origins and strongly suggest that the dominant summer AOT signal is caused by secondary aerosol formed from BVOC oxidation. A link between anthropogenic and biogenic emissions forming secondary aerosols that dominate the regional AOT is supported by reports of chemicals in aerosols formed by BVOC oxidation in a NOx- and sulfate-rich environment. Even though ground-based measurements from the IMPROVE network suggest higher sulfate than organic concentrations near the surface in this region, we infer that much of the secondary organic aerosol in the Southeast must occur above the surface layer, consistent with reported observations of the organic fraction of the total aerosol increasing with height and models of the expected vertical distribution of secondary organic aerosols from isoprene oxidation. The observed AOT is large enough in summer to provide regional cooling; thus we conclude that this secondary aerosol source is climatically relevant with significant potential for a regional negative climate feedback as BVOC emissions increase with temperature.

Its current state substantially varies from what is shown on recently published topographic maps actual for 1936. The physico-geographical mapping and GPS survey were the basic field methods of recognizing the area, supplemented by remote sensing. Each landscape component, except for the Pre-Quaternary bedrock, has been changed primarily as a direct or indirect result of the current warming. The most dramatic landscape transformation has been connected with the formation of a fjord, the abandoning of the lower parts of valleys by tidewater glaciers, and the alteration of the coastline. This transformation's pace has been increasing visibly over the last few decades. The landscape became more diversified. There is a positive feedback in the process of life expansion in the study area: the processes of animal colonization and plant succession stimulate each other.

Physical connectivity in the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System inferred from 9 years of ocean color observations	CORAL REEFS												Ocean color images acquired from the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) from 1998 to 2006 were used to examine the patterns of physical connectivity between land and reefs, and among reefs in the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System (MBRS) in the northwestern Caribbean Sea. Connectivity was inferred by tracking surface water features in weekly climatologies and a time series of weekly mean chlorophyll-a concentrations derived from satellite imagery. Frequency of spatial connections between 17 pre-defined, geomorphological domains that include the major reefs in the MBRS and river deltas in Honduras and Nicaragua were recorded and tabulated as percentage of connections. The 9-year time series of 466 weekly mean images portrays clearly the seasonal patterns of connectivity, including river plumes and transitions in the aftermath of perturbations such as hurricanes. River plumes extended offshore from the Honduras coast to the Bay Islands (Utila, Cayo Cochinos, Guanaja, and Roatan) in 70% of the weekly mean images. Belizean reefs, especially those in the southern section of the barrier reef and Glovers Atoll, were also affected by riverine discharges in every one of the 9 years. Glovers Atoll was exposed to river plumes originating in Honduras 104/466 times (22%) during this period. Plumes from eastern Honduras went as far as Banco Chinchorro and Cozumel in Mexico. Chinchorro appeared to be more frequently connected to Turneffe Atoll and Honduran rivers than with Glovers and Lighthouse Atolls, despite their geographic proximity. This new satellite data analysis provides long-term, quantitative assessments of the main pathways of connectivity in the region. The percentage of connections can be used to validate predictions made using other approaches such as numerical modeling, and provides valuable information to ecosystem-based management in coral reef provinces.				hu, chuanmin/J-5021-2012													0722-4028					JUN	2009	28	2					415	425		10.1007/s00338-009-0465-0								WOS:000265832100011

A combinated approach to investigate the biochemistry and hydrography of a shallow bay in the South Adriatic Sea: the Gulf of Manfredonia (Italy)	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The main goal of this study is to understand the hydrological and biochemical set up and processes of a marine coastal area located in the western side of the south Adriatic sea (the gulf of Manfredonia) by the use of both satellite images and in situ investigations A water sampling in the gulf of Manfredonia was performed at 18 fixed stations in June 2003; physico-chemical and biological parameters (temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen and fluorescence) were measured along the water column and water samples were collected to analyse dissolved nutrients (ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, phosphate and silicate), total nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus), chlorophyll a and total suspended solids. Surface spatial distributions of field collected data were examined to characterize biochemical and hydrographic conditions of the Gulf of Manfredonia and these results were related with the remote sensing analysis data. Remote sensed data (obtained by Landsat 7 TM and Modis Terra) were processed to obtain maps of chlorophyll a, temperature and optical characteristics of the gulf; these maps were compared to in situ data. From physico-chemical measurements no stratification was observed in the water column except for the south-eastern area. High concentrations of silicate and ammonia were observed in the northern zone of the gulf, while nitrate, phosphate, chlorophyll a and total suspended solids distributions showed higher values in the central coastal zone. These results were confirmed by remote sensing analysis; Modis elaboration showed a distribution with higher concentrations of chlorophyll a near the coast and Landsat images highlighted the extension of the surrounding agricultural areas crossed by the two main rivers which discharge into the gulf.

Changes in the shape of coastline may fundamentally affect the environment of the coastal zone. This may be caused by natural processes and/or human activities. Over the past 30 years, the coastal sites in Turkey have been under an intensive restraint associated with a population press due to the internal and external touristic demand. In addition, urbanization on the filled up areas, settlements, and the highways constructed to overcome the traffic problems and the other applications in the coastal region clearly confirm an intensive restraint. Aerial photos with medium spatial resolution and high resolution satellite imagery are ideal data sources for mapping coastal land use and monitoring their changes for a large area. This study introduces an efficient method to monitor coastline and coastal land use changes using time series aerial photos (1973 and 2002) and satellite imagery (2005) covering the same geographical area. Results show the effectiveness of the use of digital photogrammetry and remote sensing data on monitoring large area of coastal land use status. This study also showed that over 161 ha areas were filled up in the research area and along the coastal land 12.2 ha of coastal erosion is determined for the period of 1973 to 2005. Consequently, monitoring of coastal land use is thus necessary for coastal area planning in order to protecting the coastal areas from climate changes and other coastal processes.																	0167-6369					JUN	2009	153	1-4					391	403		10.1007/s10661-008-0366-7								WOS:000265917200035	18560986

Sediment particles from the Yangtze river estuary and the Yellow river estuary, as two typically turbid estuaries in China, were sampled in the field, and screened and resampled in the laboratory. Furthermore, the quantitative relationships between the suspended sediment particle size and the backscattering coefficient and remote-sensing reflectance were theoretically analysed. The effects of the particle size of sediment on remote-sensing reflectance were experimentally observed. The results provide the basis for the modelling of case-2 waters and the parameterized expression of particle size in remote-sensing models.																	1001-9014					JUN	2009	28	3					168	172		10.3724/SP.J.1010.2009.00168								WOS:000267776000003						
J	Godet, L; Fournier, J; Toupoint, N; Olivier, F				Godet, Laurent; Fournier, Jerome; Toupoint, Nicolas; Olivier, Frederic			Mapping and monitoring intertidal benthic habitats: a review of techniques and a proposal for a new visual methodology for the European coasts	PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												Mapping seafloors is a fundamental step for managing and preserving coastal zones. Moreover, in a context of current global environmental changes, new methods allowing long-term monitoring are increasingly required. Various methods have been used to map seafloors, primarily benthic macrofauna and sediment sampling along regular grids or transects, and remote sensing methods. These methods map very different things, do not have the same accuracy levels, and have different costs in time and money. Furthermore, such methods often require the competencies of highly skilled scientists and exclude non-specialists otherwise best placed to perform them. In this paper, we test a method based on Direct Field Observations ('DFO method'), which can be used by non-specialists, and assess if it is sufficient for mapping and monitoring intertidal habitats. We further compare this method with other conventional ones. The results show that such a simple method is relatively rapid and inexpensive given the results obtained. Moreover, it is particularly suitable for highly fragmented intertidal landscapes where other methods are often very limited. In consequence, in areas such as the European coasts, it can be used by non-specialists, such as protected-area managers, and because it is an inexpensive and quick method long-term monitoring is also possible.

A wet area is located in the south-west part of the Natural Park and it is characterized by a system of ponds and dunes formed by sediment deposition occurring at the Arno River estuary. The considerable amount of collected data has permitted us to investigate the evolution of wetland spreading and land coverage as well as to retrieve relevant biogeochemical parameters, e.g. green biomass, from remote sensing images and products. This analysis has proved that the monitoring of coastal wetlands, characterized by shallow waters, moor and dunes, demands dedicated aerospace sensors with high spatial and spectral resolution. The outcomes of the processing of images gathered during several remote sensing campaigns by airborne and spaceborne hyperspectral sensors are presented and discussed. A particular effort has been devoted to sensor response calibration and data validation clue to the complex heterogeneity of the observed natural surfaces. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Bio-optical algorithm evaluation for MODIS for western Canada coastal waters: An exploratory approach using in situ reflectance	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Biophysical and above-water reflectance measurements collected in 2006 were used to evaluate the OC3M, standard GSM01, and a modified version of the GSM01 algorithms for estimating chlorophyll-a (chl) concentrations in the Strait of Georgia, located off the southwest coast of Canada. The Strait was generally a case 2 water body, transitioning from chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) dominant in the central region to possibly particulate dominant in Fraser River plume regions. Results showed that the OC3M algorithm was somewhat effective (R(2)=0.550) outside the most turbid areas of the Fraser River plume. However, a systematic overestimation of lower chl concentrations was found, which may have been related to the higher CDOM absorption observed throughout the Strait. The standard GSM01 algorithm had moderately good agreement with measured CDOM absorption (R(2)=0.593) and total suspended solids (TSS) concentrations (R(2)=0.888), but was ineffective at estimating chl concentrations. Localized characterization of the CDOM absorption, through a hyperbolic CDOM model, improved the modified GSM01 results with slightly better agreement with measure CDOM absorption (R(2)=0.614) and TSS concentrations (R(2)=0.933). When the modified GSM01 algorithm was limited to regions with lower combined CDOM and non-algal particulate absorption (a(dg) (443)< 0.7 m(-1)), it was more effective then the OC3M algorithm at estimating chl concentrations. This suggests that a threshold value on the a(dg) (443) or b(bp) (443) estimated by the GSM01 algorithm may be beneficial for limiting turbidity influence on the algorithm. The further reinterpretation of phytoplankton absorption from the modified GSM01 algorithm with a two-component phytoplankton model resulted in a chl relationship with an R(2)=0.677 and a linear slope closer to one.

It experienced a rapid population growth in recent years, mainly due to the tourism industry, resulting in a significant pressure on drinking groundwater resources. In this regard, development and use of techniques to control and protect areas susceptible to contamination is crucial. The elaboration of aquifer vulnerability maps is thus extremely helpful to support water resources management. The aim of the work is to present the methodological approach in the use of Geoprocessing techniques to obtain a suitable groundwater vulnerability model in Rio de Janeiro east coast. Considering the existing problems and the current land use and characteristics of the study region, it is clear that the most vulnerable areas (that is, "extreme" and "very high" vulnerability areas), coincide with the most significant zones of urban occupation, corresponding to 11% of the total study area, demanding adoption of urgent measures in the near future. Geoprocessing tools and remote sensing for characterization of Rio de Janeiro's east coast aquifer vulnerability gave good results, representing a satisfactory method for management actions at low cost.				da Silva Jr., Gerson/C-5767-2013	da Silva Jr., Gerson/0000-0002-7160-0893												0943-0105					APR	2009	57	3					665	674		10.1007/s00254-008-1345-6								WOS:000263870000017

However, coasts, with their fertile soil and unique flora and fauna, need to be protected. In order for the use of such areas to be planned in a sustainable way by local authorities, there is a need for detailed data about these regions. In this study, the changes in land use of the area between Topburnu and U double dagger burun Musa Bey Harbour on the Ce angstrom me peninsula, which is to the immediate west of Turkey's third largest city &Aumlaut degrees zmir, from 1976 up to the present day, were investigated. In the study, using aerial photographs taken in 1976, 1995 and 2000 and an IKONOS satellite image from the year 2007, the natural and cultural characteristics of the region and changes in the coastline were determined spatially. Using aerial photographs from 1976, 1995 and 2000 and an IKONOS satellite image from the year 2007, together with "1/25,000 scale Conservation-Oriented Development Plans" prepared in 1979, 1990 and 2000 by the committee for the Preservation of Natural and Cultural Entities attached to the Ministry of Culture and Tourism of the Turkish Republic, the natural and cultural characteristics of the region and the land use changes and their connection with conservation rulings were determined spatially. In this study, spatial changes in land use over the years were compared with changing conservation rulings over the years and the emerging results have brought a new perspective to the subject in contrast to other similar studies.																	0167-6369					APR	2009	151	1-4					457	476		10.1007/s10661-008-0289-3								WOS:000263832800044	18484188					
J	D'Alimonte, D				D'Alimonte, Davide			Detection of Mesoscale Eddy-Related Structures Through Iso-SST Patterns	IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS												This letter, addressed to the analysis of remote sensing (RS) images of the sea-surface temperature (SST) off the Portugal coast, presents a novel approach to automatically detect and characterize mesoscale eddy-related structures. The complexity of this task is due to the dynamics of the investigated region, where upwelling currents and bathymetry effects produce countless and highly heterogeneous SST patterns, features of interest may have smooth boundaries, and edges associated to strong temperature gradients may not correspond to any eddy. All these limit the effectiveness of an image processing based on edge features (which can be successfully applied to automatically detect eddies in other oceanographic areas, for instance, close to the Gulf Stream). The proposed scheme exploits the iso-SST patterns associated to the eddy-related structure to code with a rule-based definition the process that allows for their visual identification. In practice, this enables revealing various morphological parameters of the eddy-related structure (i.e., the location, scale, symmetry, and rotation) and supports the exploitation of SST data allowing for annotating the RS image and benchmarking the subjectivity of the visual survey.

Analysis of the empirically derived chl a increase within the gyre has been primarily attributed to initiation of a phytoplankton bloom promoted by nutrients upwelled by Katrina's winds. Detailed analysis of inherent optical properties derived from remotely sensed radiances, however, indicated the interaction of Katrina with shallow coastal and shelf waters likely entrained waters with higher concentrations of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) into the gyre circulation, augmenting the chl a signa. Storm-induced upwelling would also transport optically active CDOM to the surface. Increases in empirically derived chl a in the Florida coastal waters influenced by Katrina's winds were therefore partly due to increased absorption by CDOM. This analysis indicates that elevated empirically derived chl a in hurricane-influenced waters should not be unambiguously attributed to increased phytoplankton productivity, particularly in an optically complex coastal environment.																	1545-598X	1558-0571				APR	2009	6	2					209	213		10.1109/LGRS.2008.2007658								WOS:000265376000007						
J	Fischer, DT; Still, CJ; Williams, AP				Fischer, Douglas T.; Still, Christopher J.; Williams, A. Park			Significance of summer fog and overcast for drought stress and ecological functioning of coastal California endemic plant species	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												Fog drip is a crucial water source for plants in many ecosystems, including a number of global biodiversity hotspots. In California, dozens of rare, drought-sensitive plant species are endemic to coastal areas where the dominant summer moisture source is fog. Low clouds that provide water to these semi-arid ecosystems through fog drip can also sharply reduce evaporative water losses by providing shade. We quantified the relative hydrological importance of cloud shading vs. fog drip. We then examined how both factors influence the range dynamics of an apparently fog-dependent plant species spanning a small-scale cloud gradient. The study area is on Santa Cruz Island off the coast of southern California. It is near the southern range limit of bishop pine (Pinus muricata D. Don), a tree endemic to the coasts of California and Baja, Mexico. We measured climate across a pine stand along a 7 km, coastal-inland elevation transect. Short-term (1-5 years) monitoring and remote sensing data revealed strong climatic gradients driven primarily by cloud cover. Long-term (102 years) effects of these gradients were estimated using a water balance model. We found that shade from persistent low clouds near the coast reduced annual drought stress by 22-40% compared with clearer conditions further inland. Fog drip at higher elevations provided sufficient extra water to reduce annual drought stress by 20-36%. Sites located at both high elevation and nearer the coast were subject to both effects. Together, these effects reduced average annual drought stress by 56% and dramatically reduced the frequency of severe drought over the last century. At lower elevation (without appreciable fog drip) and also near the inland edge of the stand (with less cloud shading) severe droughts episodically kill most pine recruits, thereby limiting the local range of this species. Persistent cloud shading can influence hydrology as much as fog drip in cloud-affected ecosystems. Understanding the patterns of both cloud shading and fog drip and their respective impacts on ecosystem water budgets is necessary to fully understand past species range shifts and to anticipate future climate change-induced range shifts in fog-dependent ecosystems.

Laboratory investigation of the acoustic response of seagrass tissue in the frequency band 0.5-2.5 kHz	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												Previous in situ investigations of seagrass have revealed acoustic phenomena that depend on plant density, tissue gas content, and free bubbles produced by photosynthetic activity, but corresponding predictive models that could be used to optimize acoustic remote sensing, shallow water sonar, and mine hunting applications have not appeared. To begin to address this deficiency, low frequency (0.5-2.5 kHz) acoustic laboratory experiments were conducted on three freshly collected Texas Gulf Coast seagrass species. A one-dimensional acoustic resonator technique was used to assess the biomass and effective acoustic properties of the leaves and rhizomes of Thalassia testudinum (turtle grass), Syringodium filiforme (manatee grass), and Halodule wrightii (shoal grass). Independent biomass and gas content estimates were obtained via microscopic cross-section imagery. The acoustic results were compared to model predictions. based on Wood's equation for a two-phase medium. The effective sound speed in the plant-filled resonator was strongly dependent on plant biomass, but the Wood's equation model (based on tissue gas content alone) could not predict the effective sound speed for the low irradiance conditions of the experiment, in which no free bubbles were generated by photosynthesis. The results corroborate previously published results obtained in situ for another seagrass species, Posidonia oceanica. (C) 2009 Acoustical Society of America.

Evaluating AISA plus Hyperspectral Imagery for Mapping Black Mangrove along the South Texas Gulf Coast	PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING												Mangrove wetlands are economically and ecologically important ecosystems and accurate assessment of these wetlands with remote sensing can assist in their management and conservation. This study was conducted to evaluate airborne ATSA+ hyperspectral imagery and image transformation and classification techniques for mapping black mangrove populations on the south Texas Gulf coast. AISA+ hyperspectral imagery was acquired from two study sites, and both minimum noise fraction (MNF) and inverse MNF transforms were performed. Four classification methods, including minimum distance, Mahalanobis distance, maximum likelihood, and spectral angle mapper (SAM), were applied to the noise-reduced hyperspectral imagery and to the band-reduced MNF imagery for distinguishing black mangrove from associated plant species and other cover types, Accuracy assessment showed that overall accuracy varied from 84 percent to 95 percent for site 1 and from 69 percent to 91 percent for site 2 among the eight classifications for each site. The MNF images provided similar or better classification results compared with the hyperspectral images among the four classifiers. Kappa analysis showed that there were no significant differences among the four classifiers with the MNF imagery, though maximum likelihood provided excellent overall and class accuracies for both sites. Producer's and user's accuracies for black mangrove were 91 percent and 94 percent, respectively, for site 1 and both 91 percent for site 2 based on maximum likelihood applied to the MNF imagery. These results indicate that airborne hyperspectral imagery combined with image transformation and classification techniques can be a useful tool for monitoring and mapping black mangrove distributions in coastal environments.																	0099-1112					APR	2009	75	4					425	435		10.14358/PERS.75.4.425								WOS:000264992100009						
J	Zald, HSJ				Zald, Harold S. J.			Extent and spatial patterns of grass bald land cover change (1948-2000), Oregon Coast Range, USA	PLANT ECOLOGY												Globally, temperate grasslands and meadows have sharply declined in spatial extent. Loss and fragmentation of grasslands and meadows may impact biodiversity, carbon storage, energy balance, and climate change. In the Pacific Northwest region of North America, grasslands and meadows have declined in extent over the past century. Largely undocumented in this regional decline are the grass balds of the Oregon Coast Range, isolated grasslands in a landscape dominated by coniferous forests. This study was conducted to quantify the spatial extent and patterns of grass bald change. Five balds in the Oregon Coast Range were evaluated using historical aerial photographs and recent digital orthophoto quadrangles (DOQ). Over the time period of study (1948/1953 to 1994/2000), bald area declined by 66%, primarily from forest encroachment. The number and average size of bald vegetation patches declined, while edge density increased. Tree encroachment into balds was inversely related to distance from nearest potential parent trees. Spatial patterns of bald loss may result from a forest to bald gradient of unfavorable environmental conditions for tree establishment and/or seed dispersal limitation. Species dependent on balds may be at risk from loss of bald area and increased fragmentation, although metrics of habitat fragmentation may not reflect species-specific habitat requirements. Tree encroachment patterns and increased bald edge densities suggest increasing rates of bald loss in the future. The remote sensing nature of this study cannot determine the fundamental causes of bald decline, although prior research suggests climate change, cessation of native burning, successional changes in response to prior wildfires, and cessation of livestock grazing all may have potential influence.																	1385-0237					APR	2009	201	2					517	529		10.1007/s11258-008-9511-1								WOS:000263888200013

Here we report on the first global remote sensing survey of fronts in the Large Marine Ecosystems (LME). This survey is based on a unique frontal data archive assembled at the University of Rhode Island. Thermal fronts were automatically derived with the edge detection algorithm of Cayula and Cornillon (1992, 1995, 1996) from 12 years of twice-daily, global, 9-km resolution satellite sea surface temperature (SST) fields to produce synoptic (nearly instantaneous) frontal maps, and to compute the long-term mean frequency of occurrence of SST fronts and their gradients. These synoptic and long-term maps were used to identify major quasi-stationary fronts and to derive provisional frontal distribution maps for all LMEs. Since SST fronts are typically collocated with fronts in other water properties such as salinity, density and chlorophyll, digital frontal paths from SST frontal maps can be used in studies of physical-biological correlations at fronts. Frontal patterns in several exemplary LMEs are described and compared, including those for: the East and West Bering Sea LMEs, Sea of Okhotsk LME, East China Sea LME, Yellow Sea LME, North Sea LME, East and West Greenland Shelf LMEs, Newfoundland-Labrador Shelf LME, Northeast and Southeast US Continental Shelf LMEs, Gulf of Mexico LME, and Patagonian Shelf LME. Seasonal evolution of frontal patterns in major upwelling zones reveals an order-of-magnitude growth of frontal scales from summer to winter. A classification of LMEs with regard to the origin and physics of their respective dominant fronts is presented. The proposed classification lends itself to comparative studies of frontal ecosystems.

Influences of upwelling and downwelling winds on red tide bloom dynamics in Monterey Bay, California	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												It has recently been shown that inner shelf waters of NE Monterey Bay, California function as an "extreme bloom incubator", frequently developing dense "red tide" blooms that can rapidly spread. Located within the California Current upwelling system, this open bay is strongly influenced by oceanographic dynamics resulting from cycles of upwelling favorable winds and their relaxation and/or reversal. Different wind forcing causes influx of different water types that originate outside the bay: cold nutrient-rich waters during upwelling and warm nutrient-poor waters during relaxation. In this study, we examine how the bay's bloom incubation area can interact with highly variable circulation to cause red tide spreading, dispersal and retention. This examination of processes is supported by satellite, airborne and in situ observations of a major dinoflagellate bloom during August and September of 2004. Remote sensing of high spatial, temporal and spectral resolution shows that the bloom originated in the NE bay, where it was highly concentrated in a narrow band along a thermal front. Upwelling circulation rapidly spread part of the bloom, mixing cool waters of an upwelling filament with warm bloom source waters as they spread. Vertical migration of the dinoflagellate populations was mapped by autonomous underwater vehicle surveys through the spreading bloom. Following bloom expansion, a two-day wind reversal forced intrusion of warm offshore waters that dispersed much of the bloom. Upwelling winds then resumed, and the bloom was further dispersed by an influx of cold water. Throughout these oceanographic responses to changing winds, an intense bloom persisted in sheltered waters of the NE bay, where extreme blooms are most frequent and intense. Microscopic examination of surface phytoplankton samples from the central bay showed that spreading of the bloom from the NE bay and mixing with regional water masses resulted in significantly increased abundance of dinoflagellates and decreased abundance of diatoms. Similar dinoflagellate bloom incubation sites are indicated in other areas of the California Current system and other coastal upwelling systems.

Use of multitemporal SAR data for monitoring vegetation recovery of Mediterranean burned areas	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Remote sensing in the optical band is a well-established tool for monitoring changes in forested areas, although it can suffer from limitations, especially where frequent cloud cover occurs. The increased availability of space-borne radar imagery offers additional means for assessing the state of forests and monitoring their dynamics. in this study, the potential of multi-temporal space-borne SAR data for monitoring vegetation recovery over burned areas next to the Mediterranean coast is investigated. In particular, the study considers a set of ERS-SAR images, C-band and VV polarization, taken over the Castel Fusano pinewood, located near Rome, Italy, devastated in summer 2000 by a fire that burned about 350 ha of the wood. Starting from the analysis of the information contained in the variations, both in burnt and unburnt areas, of the inter annual multitemporal backscattering signatures, the study presents two different approaches, one more qualitative, the other one more quantitative, for the retrieval of the biomass re-growth after the fire. In the quantitative case, the inversion procedure computes the biomass re-growth rate by means of simulations carried out with the Tor Vergata scattering model. The obtained results are satisfactory as they are in agreement with simultaneous analysis based on optical data and in-situ measurement campaigns. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

An evaluation of remote sensing techniques for enhanced detection of the toxic dinoflagellate, Karenia brevis	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Optical techniques were investigated to enhance current bloom detection capabilities in support of an operational system for forecasting harmful Karenia brevis blooms along the west coast of Florida. within the Gulf of Mexico. Algorithms pertaining to backscatter and changes in spectral shape of remote-sensing reflectance were applied to SeaWiFS and MODIS imagery during known K. brevis and non-K. brevis events. A method to remove resuspended chlorophyll in Texas showed limited use when applied to several scenes following tropical storms off the west Florida coast. This analysis suggests that an ensemble image approach, wherein a combination of a chlorophyll anomaly, spectral shape at 490 nm and a backscatter ratio product would provide an improvement in satellite detection of K. brevis blooms. For southwest Florida, the combination of these methods through an ensemble approach may lead to an increase in user accuracy by 30-50%, as a result of correctly identifying non-K. brevis features. Where available, MODIS FLH scenes were analyzed to determine their use in K. brevis detection. However, insufficient imagery was available to make a fair assessment. Similar approaches could be applied to bloom tracking and monitoring in other regions.

This study carried out in parts of the coast of southwestern Nigeria utilized topographic base maps and two-time Landsat TM imageries to assess the trend in land cover changes and ecosystems degradation for the three time periods 1965, 1986 and 2001. Remote sensing, geographic information systems and landscape pattern analysis were employed for data processing and analysis. The focus of the analysis was on land cover change, land degradation, and changes in landscape pattern resulting from interplay of natural and anthropogenic drivers. The results show increased trend in human-induced land cover change with concomitant severe negative impacts on ecosystems and livelihoods. About 98,000ha (30% of the area) was seriously degraded as at 2001. About 33,000ha (10%) was under permanent saline water inundation with about 21 communities already dislocated. Loss of fragile ecosystems including marshland (from 7.7% in 1965 to 1% in 2001) and mangrove (from 14.6% in 1965 to 3.1% in 2001) was intense, while over 300 ponds/small lakes which are important for the local fishing economy have disappeared. About eighteen communities were also dislocated by erosion in a section around the southeastern parts of the coastline. Landscape metrics generated, suggested increased ecosystems perturbation and landscape fragmentation. The paper also discussed the implications of these rapid changes for ecosystems stability, food security and sustainable rural livelihoods in the area.																	0141-6707					MAR	2009	47						30	38		10.1111/j.1365-2028.2008.01047.x								WOS:000263035500006

Morphology and modern sedimentary deposits of the macrotidal Marapanim Estuary (Amazon, Brazil)	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												The northern Brazilian coast, east of the Amazon River is characterized by several macrotidal estuarine systems that harbor large mangrove areas with approximately 7600 km(2). The Marapanim Estuary is influenced by macrotidal regime with moderate waves influence. Morphologic units were investigated by using remote sensing images (i.e., Landsat-7 ETM+, RADARSAT-1 Wide and SRTM) integrated with bathymetric data. The modern sedimentary deposits were analyzed from 67 cores collected by Vibracore and Rammkersonde systems. Analysis of morphology and surface sedimentary deposits of the Marapanim River reveal they are strongly influenced by the interaction of tidal, wave and fluvial currents. Based on these processes it was possible to recognize three distinct longitudinal facies zonation that revels the geological filling of a macrotidal estuary. The estuary mouth contain fine to medium marine sands strongly influenced by waves and tides, responsible for macrotidal sandy beaches and estuarine channel development, which are characterized by wave-ripple bedding and longitudinal cross-bedding sands. The estuary funnel is mainly influenced by tides that form wide tidal mudflats, colonized by mangroves, along the estuarine margin, with parallel laminations, lenticular bedding, root fragments and organic matter lenses. The upstream estuary contains coarse sand to gravel of fluvial origin. Massive mud with organic matter lenses, marks and roots fragments occur in the floodplain accumulates during seasonal flooding providing a slowly aggrading in the alluvial plain. This morphologic and depositional pattern show easily a tripartite zonation of a macrotidal estuary, that are in the final stage of filling. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Variability in upwelling intensity and nutrient regime in the coastal upwelling system offshore Namibia: results from sediment archives	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												The coastal upwelling system offshore Namibia is ideally suited to address a focal question of the Integrated Marine Biogeochemistry and Ecosystem Research Programme: what are the mechanisms that drive long-term changes in ecosystems? Considerable interannual variability in climatic forcing is indicated by long time series of meteorological and remote sensing observation; these accompany considerable interannual to interdecadal changes in the upwelling intensity over the last 100 years, as well as a centennial trend. On longer time scales, the only archives available are sediment records spanning the late Holocene. To decipher the sediment record, we mapped surface-sediment patterns of proxies for physical (sea surface temperature/SST from alkenone unsaturation indexes) and nutrient (delta N-15 on bulk sedimentary N) variables. Their present-day surface-sediment patterns outline the coastal upwelling cells and filaments and associated high productivity area. Analysed in an array of dated sediment cores, the spatial patterns of SST suggest long-term (>100 years) variability in the location and intensity of individual upwelling cells. The patterns of delta N-15 outline an area of intense denitrification near the coast, and advection of water with low-oxygen concentrations in the undercurrent from the North. delta N-15 exhibits considerable downcore variability, in particular over the last 50 years. The variability appears to be governed by differences in extent of denitrification and thus of the shelf oxygen balance, which appears to have deteriorated in the last 50 years. Together, the data suggest that SST and denitrification conditions have remained in the narrow bounds outlined by today's patterns in surface sediments, but that spatially small variability in upwelling intensity and make-up of upwelling feed waters induced considerable changes in the lower trophic levels of the coastal upwelling ecosystem over the last 6,000 years. Attempts to correlate proxy records from sediments with observational time series and regional climate reconstructions were not successful, possibly because annual to interannual environmental signals are erased in the process of sediment formation.

Due to their high ecological value, monitoring of arid regions is necessary and modern vegetation studies can help in the conservation and management of these areas. The use of remote sensing for mapping of desert vegetation is difficult due to mixing of the spectral reflectance of bright desert soils with the weak spectral response of sparse vegetation. We studied the vegetation types in the semiarid to arid region of Mond Protected Area, south-west Iran, based on unsupervised classification of the Spot XS bands and then produced updated maps. Sixteen map units covering 12 vegetation types were recognized in the area based on both field works and satellite mapping. Halocnemum strobilaceum and Suaeda fruticosa vegetation types were the dominant types and Ephedra foliata, Salicornia europaea-Suaeda heterophylla vegetation types were the smallest. Vegetation coverage decreased sharply with the increase in salinity towards the coastal areas of the Persian Gulf. The highest vegetation coverage belonged to the riparian vegetation along the Mond River, which represents the northern boundary of the protected area. The location of vegetation types was studied on the separate soil and habitat diversity maps of the study area, which helped in final refinements of the vegetation map produced.

The knowledge of its spectral characteristics is the basis for developing precise remote sensing inversion algorithms. Two separate continuous monitoring stations were set near the northern and southern coast of Hangzhou Bay separately, which is typically turbid area in China coastal waters. The above-water measurement method and the American ASD portable spectroscope were adopted to measure the water surface reflectance spectrum. The sediment concentrations of surface water were synchronously acquired when measuring water-leaving radiance. Results show that the sediments concentration is comparatively high and changes dramatically according to tide cycle. The reflectance spectrum at different wavelengths rises corresponding to the increase in sediments concentrations with different extent. When using first derivative method to analysis the spectral characteristic, it can be found that the first reflectance peaks of reflectance spectra appear to shift to long wavelength. There are different correlations between sediment concentrations and each MODIS channel reflectance, which are above 0.5 in 650 nm or longer wavelengths channels and below 0.5 in 400-550 nm channels. The fitting result of regression analysis is preferable with MODIS channel 2 (841-876 nm) and in situ sediment concentrations using least square method, with R-2 of exponential above 0.8, which indicated that the MODIS channel 2 can be used for surface water suspended sediments remote sensing inversion, particularly in turbid waters such as bays and estuaries.

LANDSCAPE ANALYSIS AND PATTERN OF HURRICANE IMPACT AND CIRCULATION ON MANGROVE FORESTS OF THE EVERGLADES	WETLANDS												The Everglades ecosystem contains the largest contiguous tract of mangrove forest Outside the tropics that were also coincidentally intersected by a major Category 5 hurricane. Airborne videography was flown to Capture the landscape patient and process of forest damage in relation to storm trajectory and circulation. TWO aerial video transects, representing different topographic positions, were used to quantify forest damage from video frame analysis in relation to prevailing wind force, treefall direction, and forest height. A hurricane simulation model wits applied to reconstruct wind fields corresponding to the ground location of each video frame and to correlate observed treefall and destruction patterns with wind speed and direction. Mangrove forests within the storm's eyepath and ill the right-side (forewind) quadrants suffered whole or partial blowdowns, while left-side (backwind) sites South of the eyewall zone incurred moderate canopy reduction and defoliation. Sites along file coastal transect sustained substantially more storm damage than sites along the inland transect which may be attributed to differences in stand exposure and/or Mature. Observed treefall directions were shown to be non-random and associated with hurricane trajectory and simulated forewind azimuths. Wide-area sampling using airborne videography provided an efficient adjunct to limited ground observations and improved our spatial understanding of how hurricanes imprint landscape-scale patterns of disturbance.																	0277-5212					MAR	2009	29	1					44	53		10.1672/07-233.1								WOS:000265294500006

Skill assessment for an operational algal bloom forecast system	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												An operational forecast system for harmful algal blooms (HABs) in southwest Florida is analyzed for forecasting skill. The HABs, caused by the toxic dinoflagellate, Karenia brevis, lead to shellfish toxicity and to respiratory irritation. In addition to predicting new blooms and their extent, HAB forecasts are made twice weekly during a bloom event, using a combination of satellite derived image products, wind predictions, and a rule-based model derived from previous observations and research. These forecasts include: identification, intensification, transport, extent, and impact; the latter being the most significant to the public. Identification involves identifying new blooms as HABs and is validated against an operational monitoring program involving water sampling. Intensification forecasts, which are much less frequently made, can only be evaluated with satellite data on mono-specific blooms. Extent and transport forecasts of HABs are also evaluated against the water samples. Due to the resolution of the forecasts and available validation data, skill cannot be resolved at scales finer than 30 km. Initially, respiratory irritation forecasts were analyzed using anecdotal information, the only available data, which had a bias toward major respiratory events leading to a forecast accuracy exceeding 90%. When a systematic program of twice-daily observations from lifeguards was implemented, the forecast could be meaningfully assessed. The results show that the forecasts identify the occurrence of respiratory events at all lifeguard beaches 70% of the time. However, a high rate (80%) of false positive forecasts occurred at any given beach. As the forecasts were made at half to whole county level, the resolution of the validation data was reduced to county level, reducing false positives to 22% (accuracy of 78%). The study indicates the importance of systematic sampling, even when using qualitative descriptors, the use of validation resolution to evaluate forecast capabilities, and the need to match forecast and validation resolutions.

Shoreline change analysis and its application to prediction: A remote sensing and statistics based approach	MARINE GEOLOGY												Shoreline change analysis and prediction are important for integrated coastal zone management, and are conventionally performed by field and aerial surveys. This paper discusses an alternative cost-effective methodology involving satellite remote sensing images and statistics. Multi-date satellite images have been used to demarcate shoreline positions, from which shoreline change rates have been estimated using linear regression. Shoreline interpretation error, uncertainty in shoreline change rate, and cross-validation of the calculated past shorelines have been performed using the statistical methods, namely, Regression coefficient (R(2)) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). This study has been carried out along 113.5 km of coast adjoining Bay of Bengal in eastern India, over the time interval 1973 to 2003. The study area has been subdivided into seven littoral cells, and transects at uniform interval have been chosen within each cell. The past and future shoreline positions have been estimated over two time periods of short and long terms in three modes, viz., transect-wise, littoral cell-wise and regionally. The result shows that 39% of transects have uncertainties in shoreline change rate estimations, which are usually nearer to cell boundaries. On the other hand, 69% of transects exhibit lower RMSE values for the short-term period, indicating better agreement between the estimated and satellite based shoreline positions. It is also found that cells dominated by natural processes have lower RMSE, when considered for long term period, while cells affected by anthropogenic interventions show better agreement for the short-term period. However, on regional considerations, there is not much difference in the RMSE values for the two periods. Geomorphological evidence corroborates the results. The present study demonstrates that combined use of satellite imagery and statistical methods can be a reliable method for shoreline related studies. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We present a technique for retrieving the volume fraction of water in atmospheric aerosols, and apply the technique to the AERONET database. We estimate that the volume fraction of water and the geometric hygroscopic growth factor (gHGF) can be retrieved to within 0.3 using this retrieval. The growth factors we obtain are consistent with published measurements, and indicate that aerosol water uptake is high in humid continental regions (gHGF similar to 1.3 along the U. S. East Coast in August) and low in regions dominated by desert dust (gHGF similar to 1.04 in Saudi Arabia). Citation: Schuster, G. L., B. Lin, and O.

Annual mean values of the PM10 concentrations and AOD show a strong spatial correlation, indicating the consistent presence of aerosol concentrations. However, the temporal correlation between the monthly values of the PM10 concentrations and AOD indicates a regional contrast in their seasonality. The correlation coefficients are 0.6 or higher in the southeastern coast region, whereas they are -0.6 or lower in the north-central region. The regional discrepancy is most likely due to the difference in the size distributions of aerosols. This is also supported by the data on the distribution of the Angstrom exponent and fine mode fraction obtained from the MODIS. The characteristics of the aerosols with respect to coarse and fine particles are discussed in this study.				li, dongsheng/B-2285-2012; Choi, Yong-Sang/F-8072-2013; Ho, Chang-Hoi/H-8354-2015; Park, Rokjin/I-5055-2012; Kwon, Yulee/B-8433-2009; Song, Chang-Keun/S-2255-2016	Park, Rokjin/0000-0001-8922-0234; Kwon, Yulee/0000-0002-6515-9181; Song, Chang-Keun/0000-0002-8811-2626												1976-7633					FEB	2009	45	1					33	43										WOS:000267912100003

Empirical models of toxigenic Pseudo-nitzschia blooms: Potential use as a remote detection tool in the Santa Barbara Channel	HARMFUL ALGAE												The Santa Barbara Channel, CA is a highly productive region where wind-driven upwelling and mesoscale eddies are important processes driving phytoplankton blooms. In recent years, the spring bloom has been dominated by the neurotoxin-producing diatom, Pseudo-nitzschia spp. In this paper, we relate a 1.5-year time series of Pseudo-nitzschia spp. abundance and domoic acid concentration to physical, chemical, and biological data to better understand the mechanisms controlling local Pseudo-nitzschia spp. bloom dynamics. The data were used to define the ranges of environmental conditions associated with Pseudo-nitzschia spp. bloom development in the Santa Barbara Channel. The time series captured three large toxic events (max. particulate domoic acid concentration, pDA similar to 6000 ng L(-1); max. cellular domoic acid concentrations, cDA similar to 88 pg cell(-1)) in the springs of 2005-2006 and summer 2005 corresponding to bloom-level Pseudo-nitzschia spp. abundance (>5.0 x 10(4) cells L(-1)). In general, large increases in Pseudo-nitzschia spp. abundance were accompanied by increases in cDA levels, and cDA peaks preceded pDA peaks by at least one month in both the springs of 2005 and 2006. Statistical models incorporating satellite ocean color (MODIS-Aqua and SeaWiFS) and sea surface temperature (AVHRR) data were created to determine the probability that a remotely sensed phytoplankton bloom contains a significant population of toxic Pseudo-nitzschia spp. Models correctly estimate 98% of toxic bloom situations, with a 7-29% rate of false positive identification. Conditions most associated with high cDA levels are low sea surface temperature, high salinity, increased absorption by cDOM (412 nm), increased reflectance at 510/555 nm, and decreased particulate absorption at 510 nm. Future efforts to merge satellite and regionally downscaled forecasting products with these habitat models will help assess bloom forecasting capabilities in the central CA region and any potential connections to large-scale climate modes.

J	French, JR; Burningham, H				French, J. R.; Burningham, H.			Coastal geomorphology: trends and challenges	PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												This review highlights recent work in coastal geomorphology that challenges existing wisdom, breaks new ground or contributes in some way to wider principles. Sediment transport by currents and by waves remains a major focus of coastal process geomorphology, and the contribution of this work to our appreciation of landform dynamics is particularly evident at the beach scale. Reconstructive studies over Holocene to historical timescales are yielding new insights into the adjustment of coastal sedimentary systems to progressive environmental forcing, high-magnitude events and human activities. Coastal geomorphology is currently buoyed by opportunities afforded by the implied threats of climate change and sea-level rise, and by the conceptual and technical challenges of predicting morphodynamic behaviour at the all-important 'engineering' scales. Of some concern is the lack of dialogue with other major strands of geomorphology. One of the main challenges, to create models capable of revealing emergent aspects of spatially distributed interactions between form and process, is common to all geomorphologists engaged with the meso-scale. Yet coastal specialists seem reluctant both to draw inspiration from and also to contribute ideas to what might be seen as a single, extremely broad, research front. More generally, there is little exchange of ideas or contribution to a shared intellectual endeavour. Coastal geomorphology is at the forefront of the discipline when it comes to the exploitation of new environmental instrumentation and remote sensing technologies. It can only be hoped that the plethora of high-resolution multitemporal data sets will contribute to the advance of geomorphological thinking rather than merely being used to constrain sediment budgets as a basis for the management of localized erosion problems.

Using orbital radar satellite imagery, we mapped a major paleodrainage system in eastern Libya, that could have linked the Kufrah Basin to the Mediterranean coast through the Sirt Basin, possibly as far back as the middle Miocene. Synthetic Aperture Radar images from the PALSAR sensor clearly reveal a 900 km-long river system, which starts with three main tributaries (north-eastern Tibesti, northern Uweinat and western Gilf Kebir/Abu Ras) that connect in the Kufrah oasis region. The river system then flows north through the Jebel Dalmah, and forms a large alluvial fan in the Sarir Dalmah. The sand dunes of the Calanscio Sand Sea prevent deep orbital radar penetration and preclude detailed reconstruction of any possible connection to the Mediterranean Sea, but a 300 km-long link to the Gulf of Sirt through the Wadi Sahabi paleochannel is likely. If this connection is confirmed, and its Miocene antiquity is established, then the Kufrah River, comparable in length to the Egyptian Nile, will have important implications for the understanding of the past environments and climates of northern Africa from the middle Miocene to the Holocene.

SST observations of upwelling induced by tidal straining in the Rhine ROFI	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH					13th Biennial Conference on the Physics of Estuaries and Coastal Seas (PECS)	SEP, 2006	Astoria, OR					In this paper SST imagery and a three-dimensional numerical model of a river plume were employed to detect upwelling induced by tidal straining in the Rhine ROFT (region of fresh water influence). Previous studies have shown that the Rhine ROFT in the North Sea exhibits strong cross-shore density gradients that compete with tidal and wind mixing to establish stratification. During neap periods with low mixing energy an area measuring 30 km offshore by 100 km alongshore becomes stratified. When the ROFI is stratified strong cross-shore currents are observed, with surface currents rotating anti-cyclonically and bottom currents rotating cyclonically. The cross-shore currents interact with the cross-shore density gradients to produce a semi-diurnal cycle of stratification. Due to continuity requirements imposed by the proximity of the coast, the offshore-directed surface currents and onshore-directed bottom currents should lead to coastal upwelling. A 6-day unclouded series of SST-imagery was found in May 1990 with about two images per tide. The ROM is much warmer than the surrounding water, exhibits a distinct diurnal solar heating response and is clearly delineated by large spatial temperature gradients at the edges. This indicates that the whole ROFI area is stratified. On three consecutive middays, a marked 5-10 km wide and 100 km alongshore band of cold upwelling is visible along the coastline, while in the morning and afternoon this upwelling band is not present. The timing of this upwelling indicates that it is caused by tidal straining. This conclusion was supported with a simulation with a three-dimensional numerical model of an idealized river plume showing the same semi-diurnal cold upwelling band. We believe these are the first SST images to show upwelling induced by tidal straining, as well as the large spatial scale of tidal straining in the Rhine ROFI. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Liu, Y; Li, GS				Liu Ying; Li Guosheng			Study of attenuation depths for MODIS bands in the Bohai Sea in China	ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA												An attenuation depth is defined for remote sensing purposes a's a depth above which 90% of the arising light leaving the water surface is originated. The deeper the attenuation depth, the more information of water is detectable by remote sensing, then the more precise information of water is extracted. Meanwhile, the attenuation depth is helpful to know water layer (by its thickness) from which remote sensing will be able to extract information. A number of investigators are using the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (or MODIS) for remote sensing of ocean color. It is necessary to have a rough idea of the effective attenuation depth of imagery in each of the spectral bands employed by the MODIS. The attenuation depth is directly determined from MODIS data. Though analyzing the spectral distribution of the attenuation depth on 7 August 2003 and the seasonal variation of the attenuation depth (551 nm) in the Bohai Sea indicated that: the spectral distribution of the attenuation depth for the spectral range between 400 to 700 inn is single-peak curve, and it's similar and difference in different regions is consistent with other scholars' results of zoning, moreover, it supports the Bohai Sea is Case 2 water;, the maximum attenuation depth shifts toward longer wavelengths, liking the red shift, with increase of turbidity of water, just like the maximum attenuation depth in the outside of the northwest coast of the Bohai Sea and the Bohai Strait is at 531nm, in the central of the Bohai Sea is at 551nm, in the region controlled by tire Huanghe (Yellow) River, the region impacted by the old Huanghe River, the western side of the Liaodong Bay and the eastern side of the Liaodong Bay is at 555 nm; the seasonal change of the attenuation depth is the largest in the summer, followed by the fall, and the ranking of winter and spring in different regions is distinct. The attenuation depth in different regions is dissimilar: the order of the attenuation depth in different regions from small to big is the region controlled by the Huanghe River or the eastern side of the Liaodong Bay, the western side of the Liaodong Bay, the region impacted by the old Huanghe River, the central of the Bohai Sea or the outside of the northwest coast of the Bohai Sea, the Bohai Strait (except at 412 nm and 645 nm), in which between the region controlled by the Huanghe River and the eastern side of the Liaodong Bay (and between the central of the Bohai Sea and the outside of the northwest coast of the Bohai Sea) it varies in different seasons and different bands.																	0253-505X	1869-1099					2009	28	5					39	48										WOS:000273214400005						
J	Yan, ZZ; Tang, DL				Yan, Zhongzheng; Tang, Danling			Changes in suspended sediments associated with 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami	ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH												The Sumatra tsunami on 26 December, 2004 in the Indian Ocean was generated by one of the largest earthquakes of the past 100 years. The present study investigated spatial and temporal changes of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) in North-East Indian Ocean (NEIO) after the Sumatra tsunami used satellite remote sensing data. The nLw551 products of MODIS-aqua data (using as indexing SSC) were analyzed for 5 years (2002-2006). Result shows SSC notably increased (55.6-200%) in large river estuaries along coast of the Bay of Bengal (BOB) in a short time (4 weeks) after the tsunami, especially the northwest coast of Indonesia, southeast coast of Myanmar, as well as the north offshore of BOB. Those increases were mainly caused by the re-suspension function induced by the initial Surge of the tsunami. Monthly analysis indicates increases (4.26%) of SSC of the entire North-East Indian Ocean area in 2005; especially in November 2005 when increase of SSC increased by about 6.19% compared with other years; those may mainly be caused by the destruction of coastal vegetation and modifying of estuaries or wetlands by the 2004 tsunami. The increases of SSC have different mechanism in different region and period after the tsunami. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of COSPAR.

Retrieval of Aerosol Extinction in the Lower Troposphere Based on UV MAX-DOAS Measurements	AEROSOL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Multi Axis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) has been utilized in recent years as a means of deriving vertical profiles of aerosol and trace gases; however, this new technique requires further validation because few studies have investigated its capability. In this study, vertical distributions of aerosol extinction coefficients (AECs) in the lower troposphere were retrieved by applying a recently developed aerosol-retrieval algorithm to O-4 slant column densities (SCDs) measured at a UV wavelength (356 nm) using the MAX-DOAS technique. The MAXDOAS measurements were conducted at the Korea Global Atmosphere Watch Observatory (KGAWO) located off the west coast of Korea during a period of seven cloudless days in May and June 2005. The AECs measured by UV MAX-DOAS varied from 0.05 to 0.73 km(-1) in the 0-1 km layer and from 0.01 to 0.20 km(-1) in the 1-2 km layer. The AECs for the 1-2 km layer from UV MAXDOAS are in agreement with lidar data within about 60%. Our results demonstrate the ability of MAX-DOAS as a remote sensing technique for surface aerosol measurements.																	0278-6826						2009	43	5					502	509		10.1080/02786820902769691								WOS:000264201000010

Aerosol optical properties relevant to regional remote sensing of CCN activity and links to their organic mass fraction: airborne observations over Central Mexico and the US West Coast during MILAGRO/INTEX-B	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Remote sensing of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) would help evaluate the indirect effects of tropospheric aerosols on clouds and climate. To assess its feasibility, we examined relationships of submicron aerosol composition to CCN activity and optical properties observed during the MILAGRO/INTEX-B aircraft campaigns. An indicator of CCN activity, kappa, was calculated from hygroscopicity measured under saturation. kappa for dry 100 nm particles decreased with increasing organic fraction of non-refractory mass of submicron particles (OMF) as 0.34-0.20xOMF over Central Mexico and 0.47-0.43xOMF over the US West Coast. These fits represent the critical dry diameter, centered near 100 nm for 0.2% supersaturation but varied as kappa((-1/3)), within measurement uncertainty (similar to 20%). The decreasing trends of CCN activity with the organic content, evident also in our direct CCN counts, were consistent with previous ground and laboratory observations of highly organic particles. The wider range of OMF, 0-0.8, for our research areas means that aerosol composition will be more critical for estimation of CCN concentration than at the fixed sites previously studied. Furthermore, the wavelength dependence of extinction was anti-correlated with OMF as -0.70xOMF+2.0 for Central Mexico's urban and industrial pollution air masses, for unclear reasons. The Angstrom exponent of absorption increased with OMF, more rapidly under higher single scattering albedo, as expected for the interplay between soot and colored weak absorbers ( some organic species and dust). Because remote sensing products currently use the wavelength dependence of extinction albeit in the column integral form and may potentially include that of absorption, these regional spectral dependencies are expected to facilitate retrievals of aerosol bulk chemical composition and CCN activity over Central Mexico.

Because larval dispersion takes place on different spatial scales, global operational satellite data can be successfully used to investigate the connectivity of marine populations on different spatial and temporal scales. In fact, satellite data have long been used for the study of the large and mesoscale biological processes associated with ocean dynamics. This paper presents simulations of spiny lobster larvae transport in the Tropical Atlantic using the geostrophic currents, generated by altimetry that feeds an advection/diffusion model. Simulations were conducted over the Tropical Atlantic ( 20 degrees N to 15 degrees S), considering four larvae release areas: the Cape Verde Archipelago, the Ivory Coast, Ascension Island and Fernando de Noronha Archipelago. We used mean geostrophic current ( MGC) calculated from 2001 to 2005 to represent the mean circulation of the Tropical Atlantic. We also ran the model for the El Nino geostrophic current regime (ENGC) using part of the MGC data, representing the El Nino 2002/2003 event. Results suggest that the intensification of the mesoscale ocean processes associated with El Nino events promotes the connectivity between populations, increasing the chances of a genetic flux among different stocks. We concluded that the altimetry geostrophic current data together with a relatively simple advection/diffusion model can provide useful information about the physical dynamics necessary to conduct studies on larval dispersion.

Continuous water quality monitoring for the hard clam industry in Florida, USA	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												In 2000, Florida's fast-growing hard clam aquaculture industry became eligible for federal agricultural crop insurance through the US Department of Agriculture, but the responsibility for identifying the cause of mortality remained with the grower. Here we describe the continuous water quality monitoring system used to monitor hard clam aquaculture areas in Florida and show examples of the data collected with the system. Systems recording temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, water depth, turbidity and chlorophyll at 30min intervals were installed at 10 aquaculture lease areas along Florida's Gulf and Atlantic coasts. Six of these systems sent data in real-time to a public website, and all 10 systems provided data for accessible archives. The systems documented environmental conditions that could negatively impact clam survival and productivity and identified biologically relevant water quality differences among clam aquaculture areas. Both the real-time and archived data were used widely by clam growers and nursery managers to make management decisions and in filing crop loss insurance claims. While the systems were labor and time intensive, we recommend adjustments that could reduce costs and staff time requirements.																	0167-6369					JAN	2009	148	1-4					409	419		10.1007/s10661-008-0171-3								WOS:000261581800036	18320336

This bloom is thought to be unique in the region in terms of its large spatial extent. From its first detection in the west of the country, the bloom moved clockwise around the coast eventually reaching the east coast and the Shetland Isles to the north. The bloom resulted in extensive mortalities of benthic organisms including annelids and molluscs and some species of fish. Farmed fish mortalities were absent but gill damage was reported. The availability of satellite remote sensing, phytoplankton counts from multiple sites, meteorological data and some water chemistry, as well as information on the physical characteristics of the sampling sites, provided an extensive spatial and temporal data set. Analysis of remotely sensed chlorophyll-a data from Aqua-MODIS indicated that this parameter is a useful early warning indicator of K. mikimotoi in shelf waters off the Scottish west coast, and suggested that the bloom developed in this region prior to its advection to coastal waters. An earth observation (EO) based harmful bloom classifier for K. mikimotoi recognised areas of elevated K. mikimotoi cell density but generated false positives in areas of high reflectance. Data were also used to evaluate, in Scottish waters, various hypotheses that exist to explain the formation of K. mikimotoi blooms including phototaxis, nutrient availability, cell transport and elevated water temperature. Specifically, we sought to evaluate if routinely collected environmental data (water temperature, insolation, wind strength and direction, and sea-loch aspect) could be used as a predictor of bloom magnitude near aquaculture facility locations, which typically lie within fjordic sea lochs. Path analysis was used to derive intuitive models linking environmental drivers to bloom magnitude. Once the effects of latitude such as northward water cooling were taken into account, only rainfall was a significant predictor of bloom magnitude at the sampling sites. Therefore, while the offshore development and progression of a bloom may be predicted from satellite information, it is likely that local hydrodynamic influences are crucial in determining its magnitude at coastal aquaculture sites.

Over the past decade, significant knowledge gaps have been paved thanks to the development and the recent improvements in both numerical modelling and video imagery. Nonlinear morphodynamic models, based on the time- and depth-averaged approach, allow the simulation of spatial and temporal variation of both hydrodynamics and morphodynamics in wave-dominated sandy beach settings. Optical remote sensing has been developed into a very useful tool for sampling the nearshore environment, particularly for mapping the intertidal zone topography and both the location and the morphology, of nearshore sandbars. Substantial issues to overcome remain in the numerical modelling approach, such as cross-shore sediment transport estimation, swash zone processes and the mechanism overwhelming the selforganization mechanism and the resulting sandbar reshaping into a shore-parallel bar during storm events. The various video imagery technique, often generate errors of the bathymetry estimation due the requirement of data that can only be computed through complex numerical modelling. Therefore, an in-depth interaction between numerical modelling and video imagery, is required. In a close future, assimilation of model computation and video imagery observation may accurately estimate the high sample rate wave-dominated beach dynamics.

J	de Pablo, MA; Komatsu, G				Angel de Pablo, Miguel; Komatsu, Goro			Possible pingo fields in the Utopia basin, Mars: Geological and climatical implications	ICARUS												The presence of pingos on Mars has been hypothesized since the period of the Viking mission. In fact, a diverse range of pingo-like features has been found at various martian sites including Elysium, Chryse and Utopia Planitiae in the northern lowlands. Due to the morphology and the geological setting, some of those features were interpreted in different ways, creating some controversies, as happened in Athabasca Valles. This reflects the complexity of interpreting these features by remote sensing and multiple plausible interpretations of the same feature. With the objective of identifying new possible pingos or rootless cones on Mars, we selected a study area in Utopia Planitia (10-55 degrees N, 210-260 degrees W) where the presence of both features is possible due to its geological history (volcanic and hydrological). We analyzed more than 2100 Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC)-narrow angle images in addition to Viking, Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS), and High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) images, together with Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA)-derived Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) with a Geographic Information System (GIS). We found in 94 MOC-narrow angle images dome, cone, and ring-shaped features. We analyzed them from morphological and morphometrical points of view in order to compare them with relevant features on Mars and Earth. We tested different possible origins for those features following the approach of multiple working hypotheses. We conclude that the dome, cone, and ring-shaped features could be pingos, which is in agreement with their geological settings. Regarding the driving heat source for the formation of the purported pingos, we propose the existence of a heat source, possibly a magma chamber, underneath the surface of the Utopia basin. Together with possible climatic shifts, the past activities of the heat source may have caused melting of ground ice. The pingo growth clue to freezing of the water would have occurred during the following cold climatic conditions. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

These marine plant species are concentrated in specific tidal zones along sheltered intertidal coastlines in association with estuaries and lagoons; mangroves fringe the coastline encroaching into the lower intertidal region, whereas seagrasses populate the adjacent deeper water. In most cases, the distribution of mangroves and seagrasses does not overlap. It is important to monitor the geographic extent and health of mangrove forests and seagrass beds, which serve as an important habitat for juvenile marine species. Remote-sensing data for the Khor A1 Bazam area in the vicinity of Abu Dhabi, UAE, covering the years of 1994, 2000, and 2003, were used to determine the change in mangrove and seagrass cover. Since 1994, there has been an increase in mangrove cover, likely because of plantation activity, the closure of nearby shipyards, and an increase in public awareness regarding mangrove preservation. Although more difficult to determine, a combination of remote sensing and ground-truthing indicates that the seagrass beds within the study area have likely increased in real extent over the same time period.																	0749-0208					JAN	2009	25	1					48	56		10.2112/07-0867.1								WOS:000262698900005

An Acoustic and Wireless Network Linking an Offshore Seabed Current and Wave Monitoring Station to a Shore Based Receiver	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH					10th International Coastal Symposium (ICS 2009)	APR 13-18, 2009	Lisbon, PORTUGAL	Coastal Educ Res Fdn, Ctr Estud Geograf Planeament Reg, Univ Nova Lisbon, Fac Cienc Soc Humanas				Coastal processes have been monitored for the Tugun desalination plant for over a year by attaching a I MHz Sontek Argonaut ADCP and a YSI 6600 CTD to an in-house designed seabed platform with data being downloaded every two weeks by raising the instruments to the surface, manually transferring the data via an interface cable to a laptop computer and re-deploying the system to the seabed. Analysis of the results indicate sporadic internally trapped waves travelling northward along the East Australian coast may be the "cold dirty water" described by local fishermen and whose sediment transport budget impact may be under-estimated by current coastal hydro-dynamic models. Further investigations are underway. The system being discussed and described in this paper upgrades this labour intensive methodology as it allows for data downloading to be undertaken leaving the instruments in-situ. By including an acoustic modem between the seabed unit and a surface buoy and with the addition of a Campbell Scientific CR1000 and wireless modem link a mesh radio network can be established linking the seabed unit to the shore. Real-time interrogation of the unit can then occur allowing for immediate confirmation of the equipment functioning correctly and for management decisions to be made using current and up to date data. Whilst the fundamentals of this system are not new, the novel capability is the addition of additional units into the monitoring area which are immediately picked up and added to the mesh network. Utilising this capability, a series of monitoring stations can be daisy chained away from the shore based receiver station allowing for a comprehensive array of sensors covering a wide area. Furthermore, the system is modular in construction and can be utilised for many other coastal applications that require remote sensing and data recording with the added advantage of a real-time display back to a central command node or WWW.																	0749-0208						2009			1		56		1	4										WOS:000266722300002

Assessment of Water-Leaving Reflectances of Oceanic and Coastal Waters Using MERIS Satellite Products off the Southwest Coast of Portugal	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH					10th International Coastal Symposium (ICS 2009)	APR 13-18, 2009	Lisbon, PORTUGAL	Coastal Educ Res Fdn, Ctr Estud Geograf Planeament Reg, Univ Nova Lisbon, Fac Cienc Soc Humanas				Optical properties of oceanic waters have provided an important tool for observing large scale fluctuations in oceanic conditions by remote sensing. However, there are still problems with calibrating the algorithms that link remote sensing data with in situ measurements, particularly, in coastal areas where there are adjacency affects from land on the reflectance data observed by the satellite sensor. As part of a contract with the European Space Agency to validate the marine products of the MERIS (Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) sensor on the ENVISAT satellite, this study is taking regular measurements with a Satlantic hyperspectral radiometer ranging from inshore to offshore sites, covering both case-1 and case-2 waters off the south west coast of Portugal. Water-leaving reflectances (rho(w)) were estimated from downwelling and upwelling spectral irradiances, and compared with MERIS rho(w) for a period between September and November 2008. The results of the "match-up" analysis showed that there was reasonable agreement between the data sets over the period of study at the offshore site where the land adjacency affect on the satellite data was reduced. The greatest deviation of in situ data from satellite values was at the inshore site and at the lower wavelengths of the visible spectrum, where the p,, for the blue band were most affected by atmospheric corrections. This study suggests that calibration algorithms of MERIS products with in situ data from the south west coast of Portugal could be improved by using, for example, ICOL (Improved Contrast between Ocean and Land) processing.

The goal of the field test was to show that, using this technique, wave transformations in near shore waters can be measured with high spatial and temporal resolutions in a large spatial domain (O(10(4) m(2))). These data can then be used to analyse the propagation and transformation of waves and to formulate and verify numerical models. Also, the technique can be used as a real time monitoring technique in the coastal zone. Previous studies show that stereo photogrammetry has great potential. The contributions of the present study are that (i) it is the first true field-scale test of the technique and that (ii) the stereo video algorithms have been modified to tackle the specific challenges of the problem. Most stereo matching is based upon well lit and very high texture surfaces. We face greater challenges, with variable lighting characteristics and highly variable texture. The measurements took place in Scheveningen on the South Holland coast. Two cameras imaged an overlapping area of about 5e3 m(2). Stereo images were acquired for 5 minutes at a rate of 8 Hz, yielding a very complete record of the water surface evolution. In this paper we present the results and application of the technique as a whole. Hardware requirements, calibration, correlation and triangulation techniques. Initial Results of reconstructions prove to be very promising.					de Vries, Sierd/0000-0001-5865-3715; Stive, Marcel/0000-0002-9820-6351; de Schipper, Matthieu/0000-0002-3512-6039												0749-0208						2009			2		56		1484	1488										WOS:000266722400118

Shelf Geomorphology along the Southeast Florida Atlantic Continental Platform: Interpretation of Airborne Laser Bathymetry	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH					10th International Coastal Symposium (ICS 2009)	APR 13-18, 2009	Lisbon, PORTUGAL	Coastal Educ Res Fdn, Ctr Estud Geograf Planeament Reg, Univ Nova Lisbon, Fac Cienc Soc Humanas				Differentiation of continental shelf morphology along the southeast Florida Atlantic coast was based on interpretation of airborne laser bathymetry. The 600 km(2) shelf study area included a range of seafloor morphologies. The example of the 60-km long coastal strip in Palm Beach County shows the range of morphological features that includes rock ridges, drowned beach ridges, ridge and valley topography, ridge fields, nearshore rock, structural troughs, shelf-edge coral reefs, sand flats, sand waves, diabathic channel fields, and upper slope marine terraces. Geomorphological interpretation of airborne laser bathymetry shows an orderly spatial distribution of shelf features that was heretofore unappreciated from conventional bathymetric display.																	0749-0208						2009			2		56		1494	1498										WOS:000266722400120

Application of remote sensing video systems to coastal defence monitoring	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH					10th International Coastal Symposium (ICS 2009)	APR 13-18, 2009	Lisbon, PORTUGAL	Coastal Educ Res Fdn, Ctr Estud Geograf Planeament Reg, Univ Nova Lisbon, Fac Cienc Soc Humanas				Shoreline stability is an important issue along much of the Mediterranean's Coasts. European project MEDDOOC INTERREG BEACHMED-e focused on the strategic management of beach protection for the sustainable development of the Mediterranean coastal zone. In the framework of this project, a video system has been installed in Valras (Gulf of Lions / France) to monitor coastal evolutions and recent protection works. Over the past 20 years, coastal video remote sensing techniques represent an efficient alternative tool to classical in situ surveying techniques. Coastal video monitoring is based on Time exposure images (Timex) acquisition and photogrammetry technique which allows transforming 2D image coordinates into the corresponding 2D real world coordinates. This paper presents the use of video monitoring technique to estimate the impact of engineering works. Important beach retreat has been observed for decades along the 3 km of Valras beaches and 12 breakwaters have been built until 2007. From January to May 2008, a new similar protection, a submerged breakwater and 95,000 m(3) sand nourishment have been added. As Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis has become an established method for investigating temporal beach fluctuation, EOF is performed using weekly video monitored shorelines over a 6 months period. The results show: (1) the natural erosion / accretion phases of the already protected shoreline, (2) the impact of beach nourishment and the trend toward the equilibrium position of the restored shoreline, (3) the efficiency of video monitoring for shoreline management.																	0749-0208						2009			2		56		1582	1586										WOS:000266722400138

Multi-Sensor Data Fusion for Geomorphological and Environmental Sensitivity Index Mapping in the Amazonian Mangrove Coast, Brazil	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH					10th International Coastal Symposium (ICS 2009)	APR 13-18, 2009	Lisbon, PORTUGAL	Coastal Educ Res Fdn, Ctr Estud Geograf Planeament Reg, Univ Nova Lisbon, Fac Cienc Soc Humanas				This research emphasizes the potential of space-borne optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data for coastal geomorphological and environmental sensitivity index (ESI) mapping for oil spill in the macrotidal Amazon Region. Optical (Landsat-5 TM) and SAR (RADARSAT-1 Wide 1) imageries were evaluated regarding geomorphological information content. Particular interest was placed on the Selective Principal Component-SAR (SPC-SAR) product, an alternative scheme for the fusion of TM bands with Wide Mode data through the combination of Principal Component and Intensity-Hue-Saturation Transforms. TM images have contributed to enhance vegetation and sedimentary environments based on the optical response, while Wide Mode data has allowed enhancing differences between inundation frequency and distinct moisture content. Results of this investigation have revealed significant geomorphological information with 12 units mapped in the study area. The lowest ESI was assigned to cliffs (ESI 1) and the highest was marsh and mangroves, respectively (ESI 10A, 10C). The SPC-SAR product represents a powerful toot for geomorphological mapping, providing relevant information about geobotany, emerge and submerge coastal geomorphology. An annual monitoring of both natural and human-induced changes would provide information for the construction of multi-temporal ESI maps to oil spills in different seasons and tidal cycles in the Amazon coastal zone.

Hydrodynamically Induced or Modified Patterns Derived from Satellite Images in the Coastal Waters of Estonia	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH					10th International Coastal Symposium (ICS 2009)	APR 13-18, 2009	Lisbon, PORTUGAL	Coastal Educ Res Fdn, Ctr Estud Geograf Planeament Reg, Univ Nova Lisbon, Fac Cienc Soc Humanas				Due to a complex coastline, water column properties show large temporal and spatial variability in the coastal waters of Estonia. Therefore, as an addition to relatively coarse traditional monitoring, analysis of satellite images has became an increasingly popular method. The present study focuses on the identification of some hydrodynamically induced or modified patterns, recognizable from satellite images, such as river and dredging plumes, frontal zones between water masses of different origin, upwellings and coastal jets. The main aim was to match the patterns either with in situ measurement data or hydrodynamic hindcast modelling results. We used satellite imagery (MODIS, ALI), measurements of currents, waves and water column properties obtained in 2005-2008, as well as 2D hydrodynamic modelling of the coastal waters. The results show that dredging plumes in the shallow coastal waters are often overshadowed by storm induced resuspension; upwellings along straight sections of the coast are quite frequent and well visible from sea surface temperature images, while products for chlorophyll do not reveal straightforward results; river plumes and hydrochemical fronts between marine sub-basins can be monitored both by turbidity and coloured dissolved organic matter products.

Ecological Impacts of Hurricane Ivan on the Gulf Coast of Alabama: A Remote Sensing Study	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH					10th International Coastal Symposium (ICS 2009)	APR 13-18, 2009	Lisbon, PORTUGAL	Coastal Educ Res Fdn, Ctr Estud Geograf Planeament Reg, Univ Nova Lisbon, Fac Cienc Soc Humanas				Hurricane Ivan made landfall near Gulf Shores, Alabama, as a category 3 storm in 2004, causing a storm surge of > 3.0 m and massive tree mortality in the forest around the Shelby Lakes in Gulf State Park. We documented the ecological impacts of Hurricane Ivan by means of remote sensing techniques using Landsat 5 images, coupled with a ground survey of tree mortality and damage patterns. NDVI-based land cover classifications of pre- and post-Ivan images reveal that 44% of the forest in the study area was killed or heavily damaged by the storm. Ground survey data suggest that the belt delineated as dead or highly damaged vegetation is characterized by low elevations (< 3 m) and high tree mortality (50-100% dead trees); whereas forested areas occurring on higher grounds (> 3 m elevation) suffered lower (< 50%) tree mortality. The damage pattern strongly suggests that saltwater intrusion and storm surge flooding, rather than wind damage, was the main cause for massive tree mortality around the Shelby Lakes. Results from this study are useful for interpreting the proxy records and informing ongoing paleotempestological investigations in coastal Alabama.

Variability of Pseudo-nitzschia and domoic acid in the Juan de Fuca eddy region and its adjacent shelves	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The Juan de Fuca eddy is a toxic "hot spot." Domoic acid (DA) was detected in the eddy during each of six cruises over a 4-yr study, although Pseudo-nitzschia abundance and toxin concentrations were highly variable. During the September 2004 eddy bloom, Pseudo-nitzschia spp. exceeded 13 X 10(6) cells L(-1), and particulate DA reached 80 nmol L(-1). Of the >10 species of Pseudo-nitzschia identified in this region, those coincident with the most toxic blooms are P. cf. pseudodelicatissima, P. cuspidata, P. multiseries, and P. australis. However, the presence of any particular species could not be used as an indicator of toxicity because of the high level of variability in intracellular DA in field assemblages. Pseudo-nitzschia cells were typically associated with blooms of other diatom taxa but also were coincident with blooms of euglenoids and dinoflagellates in the eddy region. Pseudo-nitzschia always comprised <17% of the total carbon biomass, thereby rendering remote sensing an unsuitable means for predicting toxigenic Pseudo-nitzschia blooms in this region. Our results support the hypothesis that the Juan de Fuca eddy region and not the nearshore zone is the primary initiation site for toxic blooms of Pseudo-nitzschia affecting the Washington coast. Although particulate DA was observed near the edges of the Columbia River plume, whether toxin can be produced in situ in plume water is not resolved. No first-order predictive relationships were found for either Pseudo-nitzschia abundance or DA concentration and environmental data from all six cruises.																	0024-3590					JAN	2009	54	1					289	308		10.4319/lo.2009.54.1.0289								WOS:000265168800023

KMA has operated a numerical ocean wave prediction system since 1992. The first major upgrade was done in 1999 with the adaptation of a third-generation wave model (WAM) for both regional (ReWAM-0.25 deg resolution, covering Northeast Asia) and global (GoWAM-1.25 deg resolution) domains. In 2005, the KMA replaced its NEC SX5 computer with a 1024-CPU Cray X1E system, a Parallel Vector Processor (PVP) machine with 128 node modules. A coastal ocean wave prediction system (CoWAM) has been designed and is currently under test mode. Six CoWAM domains, each of 3 deg longitude by 2 deg latitude in size, with a mesh size of 1 km, are nested inside the regional ocean wave prediction system. The directional wave spectra at the boundaries of the CoWAM are provided from a 1/12 resolution upgraded version of the operational ReWAM. The WAVEWATCH-III code (developed at NOAA) is used for the upgraded ReWAM and new CoWAM system. To ensure the required model performance in the Massively Parallel Processor (MPP) architecture of the new supercomputer, a Message Passing Interface (MPI) has been implemented in the model source code. The sea surface wind and significant wave height are verified routinely on a monthly basis. The global moored buoy data (including the coastal buoys operated by KMA) and remote sensing data from Topex/Poseidon, and Jason (retrieved wave heights) and QuikSCAT (retrieved wind data) are used for verification of the wave prediction system. This validation and a comparison of results from the new ReWAM and CoWAM against buoy data off the coast of Korea are discussed.																	0149-0419						2009	32	2					133	150	PII 911063376	10.1080/01490410902869243								WOS:000266025600006

Bathymetry data is used to analyze the geography, ecosystem, and health of marine habitats. Current methods for shallow water measurements typically involve large manned vessels that are costly to operate and that may pose a danger to themselves and the environment in shallow, semi-navigable waters. Small vessels, however, are prone to disturbances by shallow water waves, tides, and currents, thereby requiring more instrumentation and computation to accurately process bathymetric data. The SCU/MBARI autonomous surface vessel, SeaWASP, is designed to operate safely and stably in waters as shallow as 1 m without significant manned support in order to produce cost-effective and high-quality bathymetric maps. The SeaWASP design introduces several key design innovations in order to provide high-quality maps with a platform that is safe, stable, and inexpensive. A small waterplane area twin hull (SWATH) design features a submerged dual hull, a small waterplane area, and a high mass-to-damping ratio, thereby making the craft less prone to disturbances. Precision sensing, autonomous control, and platform-level configuration planning and control algorithms are used to navigate the boat along desirable trajectories in support of efficient map generation and to implement low-cost unpiloted operations. Bathymetry is measured with multibeam sonar in concert with Doppler Velocity Logger and GPS sensors. The vessel has been operated successfully in several open water test environments, including Elkhorn Slough, Steven's Creek Reservoir, and Lake Tahoe, all in California. It is currently in the final stages of integration and test for its first major science mission at Orcas Island, San Juan Islands, WA, in 2009. Final deployment will be at the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA's) Kasitsna Bay Laboratory in Alaska as one element of a mufti-system remote observatory. SeaWASP has been developed in partnership with SCU, MBARI, the University of Alaska-Fairbanks, and NOAA's West Coast and Polar Regions Undersea Research Center.

The area of interest included a thermohaline gradient in the channel situated between the coast and the islands lying parallel to the coast. The gradient is controlled by the influx of oligotrophic karstic riverine water at the south-eastern end, submarine springs in the middle part. and warmer offshore waters at; the north-western end of the channel. The change of temperature and salinity in the estuarine transition zone was accompanied by abundant diatoms and dinoflagellates below the halocline, with dominant chain-forming diatoms (Chaetoceros, Bacteriastrum) in abundances reaching 5 x 10(5) cells dm(-3). The impact of coastal submarine springs detected by infrared remote sensing resulted in the growth of cyanobacteria in the nitrogen-depleted surface waters. The greater contribution of picoplankton, as well as or nanoplanktonic coccolithophorids and cryptophytes, in the enter channel system indicated their preference for oligotrophic conditions. Flow cytometric counts of nanophytoplankton were 10-30 times greater than inverted microscope counts. Cyanobacteria were about five times more abundant than picoeukaryotes. The study demonstrates how different techniques (remote sensing and in situ investigations) can he useful in understanding the biological and hydrographic set-up in the specific oligotrophic eastern Adriatic coastal environment.

We first document two events of dust plume transport from the Sahara to the American coast representative of summer and winter conditions. Observed and model-derived attenuated backscatter profiles agree qualitatively well, suggesting that the altitudes of the aerosol layers over the Atlantic are well reproduced by the model. In both the model and the observations, dust plumes extend up to 8 km in summer and up to 4 km in winter over the Atlantic close to the source regions and gradually descend throughout their travel over the Atlantic. We find however that, in summertime, observed AOT are overestimated by the model close to the source regions and underestimated in the remote regions, suggesting a too weak transport toward the western Atlantic and/or a too strong deposition over the Caribbean Sea. We then use our simulation to characterize the deposition flux of dust in this region. Half of the dust deposited on the surface of the open ocean in 2006 in this area occurs during summer, 20% during each of winter and spring, and 10% in the fall. During a 1-week dust episode in July 2006 that we investigated, 5 Tg of dust were deposited (4% of the annual total in the region).

First Results from the THEMIS Mission	SPACE SCIENCE REVIEWS												THEMIS was launched on February 17, 2007 to determine the trigger and large-scale evolution of substorms. During the first seven months of the mission the five satellites coasted near their injection orbit to avoid differential precession in anticipation of orbit placement, which started in September 2007 and led to a commencement of the baseline mission in December 2007. During the coast phase the probes were put into a string-of-pearls configuration at 100 s of km to 2 R(E) along-track separations, which provided a unique view of the magnetosphere and enabled an unprecedented dataset in anticipation of the first tail season. In this paper we describe the first THEMIS substorm observations, captured during instrument commissioning on March 23, 2007. THEMIS measured the rapid expansion of the plasma sheet at a speed that is commensurate with the simultaneous expansion of the auroras on the ground. These are the first unequivocal observations of the rapid westward expansion process in space and on the ground. Aided by the remote sensing technique at energetic particle boundaries and combined with ancillary measurements and MHD simulations, they allow determination and mapping of space currents. These measurements show the power of the THEMIS instrumentation in the tail and the radiation belts. We also present THEMIS Flux Transfer Events (FTE) observations at the magnetopause, which demonstrate the importance of multi-point observations there and the quality of the THEMIS instrumentation in that region of space.

When compared with CODAR fields, velocities from the heat equation and MCC have comparable accuracies, but the heat equation technique better resolves the finer scale flow features. We use the results to directly calculate the surface divergence and vorticity. This is possible because we convert the traditionally underdetermined heat inversion problem to an overdetermined one without constraining the velocity field with divergence, vorticity, or energy statements. Because no a priori assumptions are made about the vorticity, it can be calculated directly from the velocity results. The derived vorticity field has typical open-ocean magnitudes (similar to 5 x 10(-5)/s) and exhibits several structures (a warm core ring, Gulf Stream filament, and a diverging flow) consistent with the types of flows required to kinematically deform the sea surface temperature patterns into the observed configurations.																	0196-2892	1558-0644				NOV	2008	46	11	1				3647	3660		10.1109/TGRS.2008.923321								WOS:000261309100025

Using texture analysis to improve per-pixel classification of very high resolution images for mapping plastic greenhouses	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING												The area occupied by plastic-covered greenhouses has undergone rapid growth in recent years, currently exceeding 500,000 ha worldwide. Due to the vast amount of input (water, fertilisers, fuel, etc.) required, and output of different agricultural wastes (vegetable, plastic, chemical, etc.), the environmental impact of this type of production system can be serious if not accompanied by sound and sustainable territorial planning. For this, the new generation of satellites which provide very high resolution imagery, such as QuickBird and IKONOS can be useful. In this study, one QuickBird and one IKONOS satellite image have been used to cover the same area under similar circumstances. The aim of this work was an exhaustive comparison of QuickBird vs. IKONOS images in land-cover detection. In terms of plastic greenhouse mapping, comparative tests were designed and implemented, each with separate objectives. Firstly, the Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC) was applied using five different approaches combining R, G, B, NIR, and panchromatic bands. The combinations of the bands used, significantly influenced some of the indexes used to classify quality in this work. Furthermore, the quality classification of the QuickBird image was higher in all cases than that of the IKONOS image. Secondly, texture features derived from the panchromatic images at different window sizes and with different grey levels were added as a fifth band to the R, G, B, NIR images to carry out the MLC. The inclusion of texture information in the classification did not improve the classification quality. For classifications with texture information, the best accuracies were found in both images for mean and angular second moment texture parameters. The optimum window size in these texture parameters was 3 x 3 for IK images, while for QB images it depended on the quality index studied, but the optimum window size was around 15 x 15. With regard to the grey level, the optimum was 128. Thus, the optimum texture parameter depended on the main objective of the image classification. If the main classification goal is to minimize the number of pixels wrongly classified, the mean texture parameter should be used, whereas if the main classification goal is to minimize the unclassified pixels the angular second moment texture parameter should be used.

Using High Resolution Satellite Imagery to Map Black Mangrove on the Texas Gulf Coast	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												QuickBird false color satellite imagery was evaluated for distinguishing black mangrove [Avicennia germinans (L.) L.] populations on the south Texas Gulf Coast. The imagery had three bands (green, red, and near-infrared) and contained 11-bit data. Two subsets of the satellite image were extracted and used as test sites. Supervised and unsupervised image analysis techniques were used to classify the imagery. For the supervised classification of site 1, black mangrove had a producer's accuracy of 82.1% and a user's accuracy of 95.8%, whereas for the unsupervised classification, black mangrove had a producer's accuracy of 100% and a user's accuracy of 60.9%. In the supervised classification of site 2, black mangrove had a producer's accuracy of 91.7% and a user's accuracy of 100%, whereas in the unsupervised classification, black mangrove had a producer's accuracy of 100% and a user's accuracy of 85.7%. These results indicate that QuickBird imagery combined with image analysis techniques can be used successfully to distinguish and map black mangrove along the south Texas Gulf Coast.																	0749-0208					NOV	2008	24	6					1582	1586		10.2112/07-0987.1								WOS:000261266700023						
J	Reis, S; Yilmaz, HM				Reis, Selcuk; Yilmaz, Haci Murat			Temporal monitoring of water level changes in Seyfe Lake using remote sensing	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												The Earth's water resources are endangered by inconsiderate use, pollution and lack of conservation measures. Temporal monitoring is necessary for the conservation and usage planning of water resources, and to make informed decisions. Seyfe Lake and its environs in Turkey is one of, the most important water basins in the world because it is a node on bird migration paths between Europe, Asia and Africa. for this reason, the International Council of Bird Preservation (ICBP) has registered 27 of the bird species living, at Seyfe Lake on the conservation list. In this work, the temporal changes in the water surface area of Seyfe Lake and its environs, which are important for ecological, historical and tourism reasons, are investigated. The change of water surface in the lake is examined over a 26 year period using satellite images taken between 1975 and 2001. Landsat images from years 1975, 1987 and 2001 are used. The change is tracked from the images using an unsupervised classification method. A decrease of slightly more than 33% was observed in the water surface area this 26 year period. The temporal change indicated by the images was compared with the related meteorological data between 1975 and 2001. Over this time period, climate conditions (rainfall, temperature and evaporation) in the study area have been changed by approximately 21%. These changes could have affected the Lake surface area, but also could external human interference around the Lake. Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Wang, FG; Xu, YJ				Wang, Fugui; Xu, Y. Jun			Development and application of a remote sensing-based salinity prediction model for a large estuarine lake in the US Gulf of Mexico coast	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Salinity in estuaries is highly variable due to river discharge, tidal motion, and winds. Information on the spatial and temporal changes in salinity can provide important ecological indications, but accurate monitoring of the space-time variability for a large estuary is often costly and time-consuming. This study applied remote sensing techniques to develop a salinity prediction model for Lake Pontchartrain, a large estuarine take located in the Northern Gulf of Mexico, USA. "Ground truth" salinity was measured along two transects across the take and near the shoreline. Water-leaving reflectance from the measurement locations was extracted from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images preprocessed through "banding" noise reduction and radiometrical correction approaches. Ordinary least square and ridge regression methods were performed to identify model parameters and to determine relationships between salinity and reflectance. Salinity in the take on eight dates was predicted with the developed model. Difference in salinity level and patterns, and impacts of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita on salinity were assessed with ANOVA and Fuzzy Similarity methods. The results showed that the mode achieved a high power in prediction of the take salinity (R-2 = 0.89 and RMSE of validation = 0.27). Reflectance from TM bands 1, 2, and 4 was positively correlated to salinity levels and explained 1.9%, 20.3%, and 10.2% variance in salinity levels. Reflectance from bands 3 and 5 was negatively correlated to salinity and explained 34.1% and 31.2% variance. Under normal circumstances without the impacts of hurricanes, the take salinity presented two patterns with average salinity level of 5.5 ppt. After Katrina's landfall, the average was significantly increased by 1.1 ppt and the spatial patterns were altered. The pattern on 30 August 2005 was the most dissimilar one as compared to the two normal patterns, and then followed by the patterns on 9 and 25 October, and 7 September 2005. This study demonstrated that satellite remote sensing techniques can be applied to monitor salinity in coastal environments, and that freshwater discharge not only affects salinity levels and patterns under normal conditions but also is crucial for the return of salinity patterns to normal conditions after hurricane disturbance.

Anatomy of a red tide bloom off the southwest coast of Florida	HARMFUL ALGAE												A massive outbreak of Karenia brevis that had been ongoing for several months along the southwestern coast of Florida was sampled in early September 2005 off Sanibel Island to assess the utility of bio-optical features and ataxonomic analysis (quantification of eukaryotic and cyanobacterial picoplankton) by flow cytometry in monitoring red tide blooms. Sea-surface sampling followed aircraft visual location of discolored water. Within the most concentrated area of the bloom, chlorophyll a values exceeded 500 mu g l(-1), and concentrations of nitrate (0.3 mu M +/- 0.0) and ammonium (<0.2 mu M) were depleted compared to high concentrations of total dissolved nitrogen, total dissolved phosphorus, and soluble reactive phosphorus (141 +/- 34 mu M, 16.5 +/- 2.5 mu M, and 6.44 +/- 0.57 mu M, respectively). Low water clarity in the bloom (Secchi depth transparency 0.3 m, K-d estimated at 4.83 m(-1)) was strongly influenced by attenuation from dinoflagellates as well as chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM). The fact that the K. brevis bloom occurred in lower-salinity (30 psu), high-nutrient waters implicates riverine transport of land-based nutrients as a source of nutrient supplies that fueled or sustained the bloom. Throughout ongoing efforts to advance modeling and technological capabilities that presently lack reliable predictive capability, bio-optical remote sensing via aerial flyovers along with in-water sensor data can continue to provide accurate coverage of relatively large temporal and spatial features. Flow cytometry can provide conservative (because of some cell lysis), rapid, near-real-time validation of bloom components. The concentration and position of the organisms, along with water mass scalars, can also help to diagnose factors promoting K. brevis bloom development and dispersion. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Satellite observations of main oceanographic processes to identify ecological associations in the Northern Arabian Sea for fishery resources exploration	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Ecological associations are the inter-relationship between the species and their environment. Oceanographic processes like upwelling events and formation of eddies, rings, and fronts have been monitored using National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Advanced Very High Resolution (NOAA AVHRR) and Indian Remote Sensing Satellite-P4-Ocean Colour Monitor (IRS-OCM) data. Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and chlorophyll concentration (CC) images were derived from AVHRR and OCM, respectively. Upwelling event was monitored using AVHRR-SST by detecting the differences in surface water temperature. The formation of eddies, rings, cyclonic eddies, and anti-cyclonic eddies and their biological responses were studied using CC. Eddies and rings were found with high phytoplankton production in the form of bloom, which provide grazing ground for fishes. The anti-cyclonic eddies were found with very low CC, indicating the biological deserts in the ocean. The impacts of these processes on fish catch were studied using fishing operations data procured from Fishery Survey of India. In this paper, the occurrence of different oceanographic processes, their persistence, and relevance with catch statistics of fishery resources in the study area are discussed. The study explains the potentials of satellite remote sensing to establish the habitat linkage between oceanographic processes and fishery resources.

Field investigation, profile analysis, geographical information analysis, and remote sensing were employed in combination to study the effect of sediment on Spartina alterniflora salt marshes of the coast in Jiangsu Province, East China. The results indicated that the propagation of Spartina alterniflora salt marshes was closely related to regional sediment conditions, especially the supply of fine-grained materials. Additionally, because of the dense and high grass in Spartina alterniflora salt marshes, wave energy and tidal currents were baffled and weaker than those of the adjacent, unvegetated mud flats. Fine sediment was hardly resuspended under the low energy conditions in the Spartina alterniflora salt marshes.																	1002-0160					OCT	2008	18	5					593	598		10.1016/S1002-0160(08)60053-3								WOS:000259219500006

In this study we aimed at quantifying the effects of vegetation cover and topography on surface roughness over a stabilizing dune field on the southern coast of Israel. Forty-six wind measurements were made at various distances from the coastline, ranging from 10 to 2800 m, and z(0). values were calculated from the wind measurements; based on the ratio between the wind gust and the average wind speed. We estimated vegetation cover using the soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) from Landsat satellite images for the upwind sector at various lengths, ranging from 15 to 400 m, and based on digital elevation models and differential GPS field measurements we calculated the topographic variable of the relative heights of the stations. z(0) values were positively correlated with the winter SAVI values (r = 0.87 at an upwind length of 200 m) and negatively correlated with the relative height (r = -0.68 at an upwind length of 200-400 in for the inland dune stations). Using these variables we were able to create a map of estimated z(0) values having an accuracy of over 64%. Such maps provide a better understanding of the spatial variability in both wind speed and sand movement over coastal dune areas. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This study was combined with detailed sedimentologic analysis of continuous cores, which provided a record of depositional settings developed in this area through the Holocene. The results revealed well-preserved, meandering to anastomosed drainage networks of wide palaeochannels that were superimposed by a narrower palaeochannel system. In both cases, the sedimentary record consists of sands, heterolithic deposits and muds, locally rich in plant debris. The strata are organized into fining upward successions that reach approximately 18 m thick in the wide channels and 4 m thick in the narrow channels. Sedimentary features suggestive of a coastal location for the wider palaeochannels and reworking of sediments by tidal currents include the prevalence of well to moderately sorted, rounded to sub-rounded, fine- to medium-grained sands displaying foreset packages separated by mud couplets, suggestive of tidal cycles. The data presented herein point to a rise in relative sea level reaching the Lake Arari area during the early to late/mid Holocene. This event was followed by a relative sea level drop. Tectonics seem to have contributed to an overall lowering in relative sea level in the study area since the mid-Holocene, which does not follow the same pattern recorded in other areas along the northern Brazilian coast.

The data were geometrically rectified to a standard geographical grid and brightness values were converted to reflectance through radiometric correction. Sea-truth data, collected in the field within 6 hours before/after the time of the satellite overpass, were used to derive empirical algorithms for chlorophyll-a concentration, Secchi disk depth and turbidity. Then, maps of the distribution of the selected water quality parameters were generated for the entire area of interest, and compared with analogous results obtained from SeaWiFS data. The maps indicate that the Tripoli coastal area is exposed to moderate cutrophic conditions, along most of its shoreline (in particular along the northern stretch), in correspondence with fluvial and wastewater runoff sources. The Landsat 7 ETM+ data proved useful for the intended application, and will be used to start a national database on water quality in the Lebanese coastal environment.

J	Miller, P; Mills, J; Edwards, S; Bryan, P; Marsh, S; Mitchell, H; Hobbs, P				Miller, Pauline; Mills, Jon; Edwards, Stuart; Bryan, Paul; Marsh, Stuart; Mitchell, Harvey; Hobbs, Peter			A robust surface matching technique for coastal geohazard assessment and management	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING												Coastal change is a major issue in many regions of the world, and is often driven by geohazard processes such as landslides and rockfalls. Effective assessment of such phenomena is essential for successful management of coastal ecosystems, and is often reliant on GIS-based analysis. However, while it is crucial that multi-temporal datasets can be accurately registered to a common reference system, traditionally, the dynamic nature of the coastal environment has hampered this process. This paper presents a robust surface matching technique which overcomes the requirement for physical control points, and instead derives control directly from the DEM surfaces. Although surface matching procedures are well established, performance can be sub-optimal where the surfaces contain regions of difference, such as those associated with geohazard activity or vegetation effects. The crucial aspect of the least squares matching approach developed here, is the incorporation of a robust estimation function which allows the effects of surface discrepancies to be mitigated through outlier handling. Aerial photogrammetry is an established technique for coastal monitoring, and extensive archival collections exist. However, archival datasets are particularly affected by the difficulties associated with acquisition of ground control. Conversely, the maturing technique of airborne laser scanning is less influenced by such problems, and instead is capable of producing a high quality representation of coastal terrain. This paper describes the application of the robust surface matching technique to test sites located on the cast coast of England. Photogrammetric DEMs are approximately oriented, before being matched to control surfaces derived from higher order datasets, including airborne laser scanning DEMs. The robust matching algorithm is shown to produce significantly improved results over ordinary surface matching. Analysis indicates the effectiveness of this technique for exploitation of archival datasets, revealing a signature of extensive geohazard activity over the twenty-five year study period. Robust matching of airborne laser scanning datasets has also enabled the quantification of short-term geohazard activity, demonstrating the flexibility of this strategy.

J	Slatton, KC; Crawford, MM; Chang, LD				Slatton, K. Clint; Crawford, Melba M.; Chang, Li-Der			Modeling temporal variations in multipolarized radar scattering from intertidal coastal wetlands	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING												Coastal wetlands form critical ecosystems that are very sensitive to natural and anthropogenic environmental factors. These dynamic environments can exhibit both seasonal and year-to-year variability causing significant temporal variations in remotely sensed data. Understanding these variations is necessary if time series of remotely sensed data are to be used to monitor and manage coastal environments. Coastal areas can also experience persistent cloud cover, thereby making the use of microwave sensors, such as radar, potentially attractive for monitoring. Data acquired by polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Laser Altimeter (LIDAR) sensors are analyzed to evaluate the response of a coastal marsh complex to climatic and tidal processes. The utility of L-band SAR data is investigated for detecting the presence of inundation and quantifying seasonal variations in plant phenology in several wetland environments. A coherent microwave scattering model is used to simulate radar backscatter from the marsh under different phenological and inundation conditions. Coastal marshes can exhibit scattering behavior that is different from other environments, such as forests and inland grasslands, for which scattering phenomena have been more thoroughly studied. Using a high-resolution Digital Elevation Model (DEM) derived from LIDAR data and ancillary measurements of climatic and tidal conditions, changes in the multi-polarization L-band SAR responses over a three-year period are related to specific scattering mechanisms in the marsh. Results indicate that variations in polarization preference of herbaceous marshes are often more pronounced than those observed over upland areas. Succulent halophytic plants in the high marsh respond strongly to inundation but only mildly to climatic factors, such as average daily temperature. Conversely, the response of non-succulent halophytic plants in the low marsh is strongly dependent on climate, which in turn affects their response to inundation. Results indicate that some knowledge of the vegetation phenology is required, along with scattering simulations, for meaningful interpretation of multi-temporal SAR data over coastal wetlands.

In spite of their great productivity, coastal lagoons are often impacted by human pressure which produces water eutrophication. The aim of this paper is to assess the trophic state of the two Mediterranean lagoons taking into account chemical-physical parameters, nutrient concentrations and biological parameters. Two Italian lagoons, Orbetello and Varano (respectively located in Tyrrhenian and Adriatic coast, Italy) were studied between May 2003 and April 2005. Both these systems receive treated urban outflows, agricultural effluents and rivers freshwater inputs. Field collected data showed that studied lagoons were characterized by different human and natural pressures. Orbetello showed the highest water eutrophication, highlighted by the trophic index values, while Varano showed lower eutrophication levels except for the summertime. The values of physical, chemical and biological parameters measured in Orbetello and Varano lagoons indicate that a wide spatial and seasonal gradient of the water characteristics was established during the study period, but in particular in winter. This gradient, typical of estuarine systems, was essentially due to the mixing of freshwater, seawater and anthropogenic inputs. Orbetello lagoon seemed much more affected by the urban impact and the fish-farming activities than Varano lagoon, but the latter showed a greater agriculture activities impact as showed by the remote sensing images.

J	Ober, HK; Hayes, JP				Ober, Holly K.; Hayes, John P.			Influence of forest riparian vegetation on abundance and biomass of nocturnal flying insects	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Despite widespread recognition of linkages between vegetation and insects, understanding of the ecological mechanisms underlying these relationships is limited. Better comprehension of relationships linking abundance and biomass of insects to vegetation would increase accuracy of predictions of the effects of forest management activities on insect communities. This knowledge could also be pivotal to understanding predator-prey dynamics linked to insect populations. We sampled nocturnal flying insects and measured vegetation characteristics in 34 stream reaches in conifer-dominated forests of the Oregon Coast Range in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. We considered five a priori hypotheses (resource quality, resource diversity, resource abundance, resource concentration, and stream cover hypotheses) that could explain mechanisms underlying associations between riparian vegetation and nocturnal flying insects, and used an information-theoretic approach to determine the relative strength of evidence for each. The resource quality hypothesis, which predicts that abundance and biomass of insects increases with cover of deciduous vegetation, explained substantial variation for nearly every order of insect investigated, whereas the remaining hypotheses explained relatively little. Abundance and biomass of insects had stronger associations with characteristics of canopy trees than with characteristics of shrub or understory trees, suggesting that deciduous trees are an important habitat element for nocturnal flying insects in these areas. Resource managers planning riparian vegetation management in conifer-dominated forests should be aware that manipulation of the cover of deciduous trees in riparian areas could have a large impact on these insects and their vertebrate predators. By providing information on forest canopy composition, remote sensing may offer a low-cost tool for identifying areas with high abundance and biomass of insects during conservation planning.

The combined flow of the Uruguay and Parana Rivers, which discharges freshwater into the Rio de la Plata estuary (Lat. similar to 36 degrees S), often gives rise to a buoyant coastal current (the 'Plata plume') that extends northward along the continental shelf off Uruguay and Southern Brazil. Depending upon, the prevailing rainfall, wind and tidal conditions, the Patos/Mirim Lagoon complex (Lat. similar to 32 degrees S) may also produce a freshwater outflow plume that expands across the inner continental shelf. Under these circumstances the Patos outflow plume can be embedded in temperature, salinity and current fields that are strongly influenced by the larger Plata plume. The purpose of this paper is to present observations of such an embedded plume structure and to determine the dynamical characteristics of the ambient and embedded plumes. We describe selected results of coincident airborne remote sensing and shipboard in-situ surveys of the salinity distribution and extent of the Plata and Patos/Mirim Lagoon plumes conducted under contrasting winter (2003) and summer (2004) conditions. The surveys were carried out in the context of a comprehensive multi-disciplinary study of the Plata plume and its response to prevailing seasonal weather conditions. The objective was to map the surface salinity distribution of the Plata plume at synoptic scales under representative winter and summer conditions. Additionally, the airborne survey included finer-scale mapping of specific features including the Rio de Plata estuarine front and the Patos Lagoon plume, with the objective of determining the distribution and behavior of the plumes in the estuaries and on the continental shelf. The airborne survey was conducted with art aircraft carrying an infrared and Microwave radiometer system, the Naval Research Laboratory's (NRL) Salinity, Temperature and Roughness Remote Scanner (STARRS). A series of broad-scale flights over the continental shelf off Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil were made using STARRS to determine the spatial extent of the Plata plume, and detailed mapping flights were undertaken in the vicinity of Rio de la Plata Estuary and Patos/Mirim outflows to observe associated frontal features. The results of the airborne surveys were compared with shipboard hydrographic data obtained from a conductivity, temperature and depth (CTD) profiler. The combined ship and aircraft data were used to estimate parameters of dynamical classification schemes. These schemes were used to characterize the gross behavior and dynamics of the ambient Plata plume and embedded Patos plume. The Plata plume was highly asymmetric with along-shelf development towards the north and it behaved dynamically like a buoyant coastal boundary current, with an approximately geostrophic across-shelf momentum balance. The Patos plume, on the other hand, maintained its integrity as a relatively symmetric, ageostrophic, frictionally dominated plume with significant across-shelf, and modest along-shelf, development.

On extracting the waterlines, we considered the tidal flat environments, such as tidal conditions, remnant surface water, suspended sediment, and exposure time. Ground levelling was carried out along one line in 1991, and two lines in 2000. From the extracted waterlines and ground levelling data, we succeeded in generating intertidal DEMs with an accuracy of 10.9 cm r.m.s. overall, and 7.3 cm r.m.s. in the lower tidal flats. The morphologic changes estimated by subtracting the two DEMs showed an erosion rate of -9.0 cm over 9 yr that corresponds to an annual mean morphologic change budget of -309,865 m(3)/yr. Overall, the Gomso tidal flats can be defined as an erosion-dominant environment. The changes with respect to the sedimentary facies were also evaluated as: (a) the sandy silt flat had a sedimentation rate of -3.4 cm over 9 yr that corresponds to an annual mean budget of -52,552 m(3)/yr; (b) the silty sand flat had a sedimentation rate of - 14.3 cm over 9 yr that corresponds to a mean erosion of - 197,927 m(3)/yr; and (c) the sand flat had a sedimentation rate of - 11.8 cm over 9 yr that corresponds to a mean change of -58,808 m(3)/yr. The results comply with the general rules of sedimentology. We also investigated the chenier migration, which is the most dynamic geomorphologic change in the tidal flats. Chenier is usually composed by sand and shell as a result of coastal progradation in sand, and it is dominantly fed by sediments transported by long-shore currents. The chenier was found to have migrated about 148 m landward over 6 yr. The results demonstrate that satellite remote sensing is an efficient and effective tool for a long-term morphologic change estimation in tidal flats. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Shanmugam, P; Ahn, YH; Ram, PS				Shanmugam, Palanisamy; Ahn, Yu-Hwan; Ram, Prakya Shree			SeaWiFS sensing of hazardous algal blooms and their underlying mechanisms in shelf-slope waters of the Northwest Pacific during summer	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												RCA-chlorophyll (red tide index chlorophyll algorithm - RCA) estimates from the SeaWiFS, sea surface height (SSH) variations/geostrophic currents from the multi-satellite altimeters, sea surface temperature (SST) from the NOAA-AVHRR, and wind speed/direction from the QuikSCAT are used in conjugation with field observation data to first describe comprehensively the occurrences of various hazardous algal blooms (HABs) and their underlying mechanisms and link to nutrient enrichment during the summer (June-September) in shelf-slope waters off the Northwest Pacific (NWP) covering China, Korea, Japan and Russia (perhaps this is the first satellite-based study in Russia). These datasets provide a coherent view of the summertime evolution of HABs and related physical processes in the above regional segments with four common dynamic regions: coastal cold/estuary water zones, upwelling zones next to the coast, repeated meanders/eddies, and frontal regimes induced by the Kuroshio and its tributaries. Summer HABs numerically dominated by dinoflagellates and diatoms (only in few cases) were initiated in these hydrodynamically active coastal regions and subsequently transported throughout their coastal and oceanic ranges by major currents and eddy systems. As a consequence, dense and colossal blooms displayed mean RCA of > 7 mg m(-3) and TBCA (total bloom covered area) of > 20 x 10(3) km(2), which limits the research vessels to observe concomitantly their spatially explicit phases together with physical oceanographic features in such large regions. Less dense and spatially disbanded blooms were characterized by mean RCA of < 3 mg m(-3) and TBCA of < 8 x 10(3) km(2). Besides those of the nutrient-abundant zones, high blooms coincided with the coastal upwelling and cyclonic eddy regimes that followed SST minimum and large negative SSH along with favorable phase of winds. By contrast, relatively low mean RCA were consistent with the fronts and anticyclonic meanders revealing moderate-high SSH fields along with variable winds blown off the NWP coast. These anticyclonic meanders, on some occasions, when nutrient-containing coastal water setoff higher chlorophyll biomass and major currents gained force in August, straddled the continental margin, entraining high chlorophyll water from the coast and from the adjacent cyclonic eddies (and upwelling) located nearby into their outer rings that formed a conveyer-belt system of transport to inject coastal blooms into the deep-sea (e.g., East Sea) region of the NWP. The above findings based on satellite data combined with field hydrographic/bloom observation data evidently illustrated richness of the response of summer HABs to the surface circulation and nutrient enrichment processes in shelf-slope waters off the NWP coast.

Estimation of transboundary transport of pollution aerosols by remote sensing in the eastern Mediterranean	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												[1] Quantifying transboundary transport of pollution is important for understanding the global distribution of pollution and pollutant burdens in regional and global scales. Using observations from the Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS) on board the Terra and Aqua satellites, the transport of pollution sulfate aerosol was estimated in the eastern Mediterranean. Over a 150 km line west of the Israeli coast, the estimated annual sulfate flux is in a range of 0.025 to 0.062 Tg S a(-1). These estimates are consistent with airborne measurements which estimated an annual flux of sulfate of 0.024-0.054 TgS a(-1). The MODIS-based estimates are also in good agreement with estimates of seasonal and annual fluxes from the GOCART model. This case study demonstrates a feasible way to estimate transboundary transport of pollution aerosol by remote sensing means.

In this paper, seasonal, yearly and decadal (i.e. long-term) behavior of coastal morphological features is derived from field data by using both simple and advanced statistical techniques. The sedimentary features which we are especially focusing on are a) nearshore bars, and b) large-scale shoreline undulations, for example, longshore sand waves and nesses. High-quality bathymetric field data of regularly sampled cross-shore profiles and shorelines were the basis of the available data sets at Noordwijk beach (The Netherlands), Duck, North Carolina (USA), Sylt (Germany), Lubiatowo (Poland) and Winterton (UK). Additional data sets from Argus video-images (see [Holman, R.A., Stanley, J., 2007. The history, capabilities and future of Argus. Coastal Engineering Special Issue of the CoastView project. doi: 10.1016/j.coastaleng.2007.01.003]) and aerial photographs were used to increase the temporal and spatial resolution of the data sets where possible. The statistical methods applied include some linear and non-linear techniques described by Larson et al. [Larson, M., Capobianco, M., Jansen, H., Rozyfiski, G., Southgate, H.N., Stive, M., Wijnberg, K.M., Hulscher, S., 2003. Analysis and modeling of field data on coastal morphological evolution over yearly and decadal time scales. Part 1: background and linear techniques. Journal of Coastal Research, 19-4, 760-775] and Southgate et al. [Southgate, H.N., Wijnberg, K.M., Larson, M., Capobianco, M., Jansen, H., 2003. Analysis of field data of coastal morphological evolution over yearly to decadal timescales. Part 2: non-linear techniques. Journal of Coastal Research, 19-4, 776-789]. The methods proved to be useful for extracting characteristics of the coastal sedimentary features concerning length scales (e.g., spacing and rhythmicity) and temporal scales (e.g., migration rates and evolutionary patterns). However, the success of the statistical analysis strongly depends on the total size of the data set characterized by the specific spatial coverage, spatial resolution, temporal resolution, and overall length in time. Recent data sets from remote sensing video systems like Argus often meet these requirements and are of major importance for the formulation of conceptual behavior models. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

J	Fagherazzi, S; Du, XZ				Fagherazzi, Sergio; Du, Xizhen			Tsunamigenic incisions produced by the December 2004 earthquake along the coasts of Thailand, Indonesia and Sri Lanka	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Field observations and satellite images indicate that tsunami waves exhibit specific patterns during flooding and recession forming characteristic incisions in the coastal landscape. To study these incisions we analyze high resolution remote sensing images of the coastline of Indonesia, Thailand and Sri Lanka impacted by the tsunami of December 26th, 2004. The analysis sheds light on the different mechanisms by which currents scour incisions during the flooding and receding phases of a tsunami. During flooding the high velocity flow indents the levees of existing tidal channels and bays, leaving short flood scours. The receding water then dissects the coastline with equally spaced return channels widening toward the coast. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Cobb, M; Keen, TR; Walker, ND				Cobb, Mark; Keen, Timothy R.; Walker, Nan D.			Modeling the circulation of the Atchafalaya Bay system during winter cold front events. Part 1: Model description and validation	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												The Atchafalaya Bay system consists of a series of five shallow bays in southern Louisiana (U.S.A.) that are dominated by the circulation of the Atchafalaya River plume. Winter cold fronts have a significant impact on the resuspension and transport of sediments in this region, and a better understanding of the circulation during these events is absolutely necessary for determining the sediment transport patterns of the Atchafalaya Bay system and the adjacent shelf area. Understanding the circulation of this region is also crucial for environmental studies as well. This work describes the implementation of the Navy Coastal Ocean Model (NCOM), a three-dimensional numerical circulation model for tide, river, and wind-forced circulation in the Atchafalaya Bay system. The model has a cell size (Delta x) of similar to 800 m and is nested to a northern Gulf of Mexico model (Ax similar to 5000 m), which is itself nested to the global NCOM (Delta x = 1/8 degrees). Atmospheric forcing is supplied by the Navy Operational Global Atmospheric Prediction System (NO-GAPS) (Delta x = 1 degrees). These models are used to simulate the hydrodynamics of the Atchafalaya Bay system and Atchafalaya river plume between December 1997 and January 1998 during the passage of three winter cold fronts. The water levels, salinity, and currents predicted by NCOM are in reasonable agreement with available measurements and tide-gauge elevation data. Errors in ebb tides and wind-driven circulation are attributable to uncertainties in the bathymetry and the low spatial and temporal resolution of the NOGAPS wind fields.

J	Cobb, M; Keen, TR; Walker, ND				Cobb, Mark; Keen, Timothy R.; Walker, Nan D.			Modeling the circulation of the Atchafalaya Bay system, part 2: River plume dynamics during cold fronts	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												In Part 2 of our application of the Navy coastal ocean model (NCOM) to the Atchafalaya Bay system, we examine the wind- and tide-forced three-dimensional baroclinic circulation of the Lower Atchafalaya and Wax Lake Outlet river plumes. The salinity and the current velocity are examined during a time period when three cold fronts passed over the region. The baroclinic, circulation of NCOM was validated for the same time period in Part 1 of this study (COBB, KEEN, and WALKER, 2008. Modeling the circulation of the Atchafalaya Bay region, 1: Model description and validation. Journal of Coastal Research, this issue). We find that the westward transport of plume water and the offshore cold-front-induced circulation are determined to a large extent by the alongshore and cross-shore bathymetric structure. Wind-driven plume water moves parallel to the alongshore bathymetric contours unless forced to mix with higher salinity water by strong cross-shore directed winds. The mixing of plume water with offshore water occurs over bathymetric shoals during periods of strong post-frontal winds. This mixing process involves the offshore transport of plume water over the entire water column in addition to the strong surface transport. The model results for offshore circulation are in qualitative agreement with past observations. In addition, the hydrodynamic processes that control the salinity fronts in Vermilion and West Cote Blanche Bays, areas where the model salinity was validated in Part 1, are examined as well.

Short-term influences on suspended particulate matter distribution in the northern Gulf of Mexico: Satellite and model observations	SENSORS												Energetic meteorological events such as frontal passages and hurricanes often impact coastal regions in the northern Gulf of Mexico that influence geochemical processes in the region. Satellite remote sensing data such as winds from QuikSCAT, suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentrations derived from SeaWiFS and the outputs ( sea level and surface ocean currents) of a nested navy coastal ocean model (NCOM) were combined to assess the effects of frontal passages between 23-28 March 2005 on the physical properties and the SPM characteristics in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Typical changes in wind speed and direction associated with frontal passages were observed in the latest 12.5 km wind product from QuikSCAT with easterly winds before the frontal passage undergoing systematic shifts in direction and speed and turning northerly, northwesterly during a weak and a strong front on 23 and 27 March, respectively. A quantitative comparison of model sea level results with tide gauge observations suggest better correlations near the delta than in the western part of the Gulf with elevated sea levels along the coast before the frontal passage and a large drop in sea level following the frontal passage on 27 March. Model results of surface currents suggested strong response to wind forcing with westward and onshore currents before the frontal passage reversing into eastward, southeastward direction over a six day period from 23 to 28 March 2005. Surface SPM distribution derived from SeaWiFS ocean color data for two clear days on 23 and 28 March 2005 indicated SPM plumes to be oriented with the current field with increasing concentrations in nearshore waters due to resuspension and discharge from the rivers and bays and its seaward transport following the frontal passage. The backscattering spectral slope., a parameter sensitive to particle size distribution also indicated lower. values ( larger particles) in nearshore waters that decreased offshore ( smaller particles). The use of both satellite and model results revealed the strong interactions between physical processes and the surface particulate field in response to the frontal passage in a large riverdominated coastal margin.																	1424-8220					JUL	2008	8	7					4249	4264		10.3390/s8074249								WOS:000258180500013	27879933					
J	Xie, JP; Zhu, J; Li, Y				Xie, Jiping; Zhu, Jiang; Li, Yan			Assessment and inter-comparison of five high-resolution sea surface temperature products in the shelf and coastal seas around China	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												Recently the global ocean data assimilation experiment (GODAE) High-Resolution SST Pilot Project (GHRSST-PP) has delivered several sea surface temperature (SST) products based on satellite remote-sensing observations. These cloud-free, high spatial (up to 2-5 km) and temporal resolution (daily or 6-hourly) SST products provide important data sources for operational ocean forecast of both global and shelf/coastal seas. Before applying the GHRSST products to initialization or data assimilation for ocean forecasting of shelf and coastal seas, it is necessary to make inter-comparison and assessment of these products. In this paper, five products were investigated by means of inter-comparison and comparison to in situ observations at the shelf and coastal sea around China and in the northwest Pacific over 1-year period (from October 2005 to September 2006). The inter-comparison shows that in the coastal and the shelf sea around China, there are some significant differences among these products. Some have warm bias with reference to the five-member mean, while some have cold biases. In shelf seas around China, the spread of the five products is between 0.4 and 0.6 degrees C. In the coastal sea (shallower than 40 m), the spread increases dramatically to 0.95 degrees C. Further, the comparison of daily GHRSST products with in situ night-time SST observations from surface drifters and ship reports indicated that most of these SST products are excellent in deep water region. The root mean square differences (RMSDs) of some products with reference to in situ observations are less than 0.4 degrees C. But near the coastal, relatively large bias and RMSD exist in all five products. In order to reduce the bias and RMSD in near coast, a simple, depth-dependent bias correction scheme is applied to two of the five products. After correction their biases can be reduced, and their RMSDs could be also decreased about 6-14%. This study suggests that the GHRSST products can be used for operational ocean forecasting with proper error estimation for shelf seas and the open ocean. For the coastal seas where the depths are shallower than 40 m, large uncertainties exist in these products. Improvements are needed for future application in the coastal seas. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

A coastal ocean extreme bloom incubator	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Novel remote sensing methods and in situ observations reveal that intense dinoflagellate blooms occur frequently in Monterey Bay, California. Blooms can contain surface chlorophyll concentrations exceeding 500 mu g l(-1) and occupy similar to 5 to 80 km(2). They occur primarily during August through November and can persist for > 1 month. Maximum bloom frequency and mean intensity are in a shallow (< 25 m depth) area of the northeastern bay, in coincidence with the warmest surface water, low wind stress, and retentive circulation. These conditions favor dinoflagellates, which can vertically migrate to acquire nutrients in the thermocline and aggregate as "red tide" near the surface. Bloom incubation areas, also indicated in other coastal upwelling systems, may disproportionately influence regional bloom ecology.

Estimates of tree canopy loss as a result of Cyclone Monica, in the Magela Creek catchment northern Australia	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												Severe tropical Cyclone Monica impacted the coast of northern Australia in April 2006 with estimated maximum wind gusts of 360 km h(-1). It rapidly moved inland losing intensity and passed over the town of Jabiru as a category 2 system, with maximum wind gusts recorded at 135 km h(-1). The cyclone had a significant impact on the landscapes within the Alligator Rivers Region and significant windthrow of trees occurred. This paper describes the level of impact that category 2 level winds had on tree canopy loss 10 days after cyclone and then again 1 year later. Recovery was assessed using multispectral satellite imagery in sub-catchments of the Magela Creek catchments. A non-linear relationship was fitted between a modified vegetation index (derived from Landsat TM5 satellite data) and percentage tree canopy cover (measured from very high resolution QuickBird satellite data). The results of the non-linear relationship, used to estimate percentage canopy cover, indicate that 10 days after cyclone, there was significant disturbance to tree canopy. However, data 1 year after cyclone show that recovery of canopy across the studied catchments varied between 8% and 19% of the percentage canopy cover that remained after the initial impact of the cyclone. Further analysis in the three sub-catchments using Geographical Information System showed that proportionally, riparian zones and inundated areas in each of the sub-catchments suffered greater loss of tree canopy cover compared with upland areas.

Blooms of Noctiluca miliaris in the Arabian Sea - An in situ and satellite study	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												Phytoplankton cell density, chlorophyll a (chl a) concentration and pigment data collected during a series of five cruises in the northern Arabian Sea in the Northeast Monsoon (NEM, Nov-Jan) and the Spring Intermonsoon (SIM, Mar-May) since 2003 contradicted the established notion that winter blooms mainly consist of diatom communities. Recent data show that following the NEM and well into the SIM, phytoplankton populations are dominated by the dinoflagellate Noctiluca miliaris Suriray (synonym Noctiluca scintillans Macartney). In the SIM they were often in association with the well-known blooms of the diazotroph Trichodesmium sp. Large blooms of N. miliaris have also begun making their appearance annually in the Gulf of Oman and off the coast of Oman. This study uses NASA's recently developed product of merged SeaWiFS and Aqua-MODIS chl a data to investigate the temporal evolution and spatial extent of these taxonomically validated blooms. Satellite chl a in relation to Aqua-MODIS SST and altimetry data suggest that mesoscale eddies that populate the western Arabian Sea during the NEM contribute to the genesis and dispersal of these blooms from the Gulf of Oman into the central Arabian Sea.

Aeolian fetch distance and secondary airflow effects: the influence of micro-scale variables on meso-scale foredune development	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												Unsuccessful attempts to use process-scale models to predict long-term aeolian sediment transport patterns have long been a feature of aeolian research. It has been proposed that one approach to overcome these problems is to identify micro-scale variables that are important at longer timescales. This paper assesses the contribution of two system variables (secondary airflow patterns and fetch distance) to medium-term (months to years) dune development. The micro-scale importance of these variables had been established during previous work at the site (Magilligan Strand, Northern Ireland). Three methods were employed. First, sand drift potentials were calculated using 2 years of regional wind data and a sediment transport model. Second, wind data and large trench traps (2 m length x 1 m width x 1.5 m depth) were used to assess the actual sediment transport patterns over a 2-month period. Third, a remote-sensing technique for the identification of fetch distance, a saltation impact sensor (Safire) and wind data were utilized to gauge, qualitatively, sediment transport patterns over a 1-month period. Secondary airflow effects were found to play a major role in the sediment flux patterns at these timescales, with measured and predicted rates matching closely during the trench trap study. The results suggest that fetch distance is an unimportant variable at this site. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Case study: the Kotychi lagoon (western Greece)	GEOLOGICA CARPATHICA												The Kotychi lagoon is located on the northwest Peloponnese Greece, along a wave dominated and microtidal coast. The lagoon is one of the most important ecological areas in Greece, with international significance as it is protected by the Ramsar International Convention and is listing in the Natura (E.C.) Catalogue. For the present study 59 surficial samples were collected from the bottom of the lagoon, on a grid basis (approximately 300 m spacing) using a grab and were analysed for their grain size distribution as well as grain size parameters, mean, variance and skewness. Using the moment measures, grain-size trend analysis was made and the definition of trend vectors were estimated. Grain-size trend analysis indicates that the sediments of the lagoon are mainly sandy mud. Application of trend analysis indicates that the sediment pathways along the lagoon can be related to a) the sediments source area of the lagoon (small river supplies), b) wind related water circulation and c) the NW and SW wind directions. Moreover, comparing 1990 and 2000 satellite images we have detected three major areas where the shallow waters show a significant increase: area (a) in the northeast part of the lagoon, area (b) in the middle-west part and area (c) in the southern part. All these changes are related to river discharges and to the winnowing effect. Detection of changes in the coastline of the lagoon, showed a total reduction of areas covered by water by up to 13.8%. The biggest change was detected in the northeast and in the southeast area of the lagoon and is related to the sediment supply from the periphery of the lagoon and to a minor degree to the bottom sediment pathway and winnowing effect. The rate of change of the area covered by water shows a rapid filling up of the lagoon and that additional measures have to applied for the protection of the lagoon ecosystem.																	1335-0552					JUN	2008	59	3					261	268										WOS:000257416900006

Inter sensor comparison between RESOURCESAT LISS III, LISS IV and AWiFS with reference to coastal landuse/landcover studies	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												Coastal zone assumes importance due to high productivity of ecosystems, man-made developmental activities, natural hazards and dynamic nature of the coast. As costal ecosystems are unique and fragile, understanding the impact of developmental activities on the sustainability of the coastal zone is very important. Remote sensing, because of repetitive and synoptic nature is an ideal tool for studying this. Time series data analyses for monitoring coastal zone require different type of sensors. Present study deals with atmospheric correction of satellite data, reflectance, selection of coastal features like, mudflat, mangroves, vegetated dune, coastal water, etc. and their inter-comparison using different sensor data of RESOURCESAT sensors. Reflectance values give better separateability for various coastal features in comparison to DN values. LISS IV can be used in place of LISS III or merged (LISS III + PAN) for long-term coastal zone studies. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Two land use maps derived using remote sensing were used. One map derived from Quickbird satellite images of 150 km(2) of the Simpenan and Ciemas subdistricts (106 degrees 27'53"-106 degrees 38'38" E and 6 degrees 59'59"-7 degrees 8'46" S) in Sukabumi and one using ASTER images covering 4,000 km(2) of Sukabumi District from 106 degrees 22'15"- 107 degrees 4'1" E and 6 degrees 42'50"-7 degrees 26'13" S. There was a total of 11 Anopheles spp. collected from 209 sampling locations in the area covered by the Quickbird image and a total of 15 Anopheles spp. collected from 1,600 sampling locations in the area covered by the ASTER map. For the area covered by the land use maps, ten species were found to have statistically positive relationships between land use class and species presence: Anopheles aconitus, An. annularis, An. barbirostris. An. flavirostris, An. insulaeflorum, An. kochi, An. maculatus, An. subpictus, An. sundaicus, and An. vagus. Quickbird and ASTER satellite images both produced land maps that were adequate for predicting species presence in an area. The land use classes associated with malaria vector breeding were rice paddy (An. aconitus, An. subpictus), plantation located near or adjacent to human settlements (An. maculatus), bush/shrub (An. aconitus, An. maculatus, An. sundaicus), bare land, and water body land use on the coast located <= 250 m of the beach (An. sundaicus). Understanding the associations of habitat and species in one area, predictions of species presence or absence can be made prior to a ground survey allowing for accurate vector survey and control planning.																	1081-1710					JUN	2008	33	1					30	39		10.3376/1081-1710(2008)33[30:RLUPAT]2.0.CO;2								WOS:000257592100004	18697304

A systematic method for 3D mapping of mangrove forests based on Shuttle Radar Topography Mission elevation data, ICEsat/GLAS waveforms and field data: Application to Cienaga Grande de Santa Marta, Colombia	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Mangrove forests are found within the intertropical zone and are one of the most biodiverse and productive wetlands on Earth. We focus oil the Cienaga Grande de Santa Marta (CGSM) in Colombia, the largest coastal lagoon-delta ecosystem in the Caribbean area with an extension of 1280 kin 2, where one of the largest mangrove rehabilitation projects in Latin America is currently underway. Extensive man-made hydrological modifications in the region caused hypersaline soil (>90 g kg(-1)) conditions since the 1960s triggering a large dieback of mangrove wetlands (similar to 247 km(2)). In this paper, we describe a new systematic methodology to measure mangrove height and aboveground biomass by remote sensing. The method is based on SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) elevation data, ICEsat/GLAS waveforms (Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite/Geoscience Laser Altimeter System) and field data. Since the locations of the ICEsat and field datasets do not coincide, they are used independently to calibrate SRTM elevation and produce a map of mangrove canopy height. We compared height estimation methods based on waveform centroids and the canopy height profile (CHP). Linear relationships between ICEsat height estimates and SRTM elevation were derived. We found the centroid of the canopy waveform contribution (CWC) to be the best height estimator. The field data was used to estimate a SRTM canopy height bias (-1.3 m) and estimation error (rms = 1.9 m). The relationship was applied to the SRTM elevation data to produce a mangrove canopy height map. Finally, we used field data and published allometric equations to derive an empirical relationship between canopy height and biomass. This relationship was used to scale the mangrove height map and estimate aboveground biomass distribution for the entire CGSM. The mean mangrove canopy height in CGSM is 7.7 m and most of the biomass is concentrated in forests around 9 m in height. Our biomass maps will enable estimation of regeneration rates of mangrove forests under hydrological rehabilitation at large spatial scales over the next decades. They will also be used to assess how highly disturbed mangrove forests respond to increasing sea level rise under current global climate change scenarios. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Assessment of the visual impact of marble quarry expansion (1984-2000) on the landscape of Thasos island, NE Greece	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING												Marble extraction is an economically important and widespread activity in Greece that exists since historical times. The extraction takes place by open-pit quarries in hill slopes. The original landform. is permanently altered and the original vegetation cover is destroyed. The visual impact of the quarries extends over larger areas as noticeable scars of high colour contrast, reducing the aesthetic appeal of the landscape and deteriorating the scenic quality of areas where tourism often is a major constituent of income. The aim of this work was to assess the ecological, landscape and visual impacts of marble quarries on the island of Thasos, NE Greece by employing remote sensing, geographical analysis and landscape metrics. Change detection and object-based classification were used to monitor the landscape dynamics (1984-2000) of marble quarries. A new index was defined to estimate the 'cumulative visibility load' on the landscape. An expansion trend of marble quarries was identified by the creation of new and the enlargement of existing quarries in the NE part of the island on areas previously covered by semi-natural pine forest. The visual impact increased by a factor of 2.52 and although the area of quarries was less than 1% of the landscape in 2000, it affected 13.5% of the island, including areas such as the island's capital and nearby coasts.

Evolution of Malvan Coast, Konkan, west coast of India - A case study using remote sensing data	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Konkan is the coastal lowland extending east-west from the Arabian Sea to the Western Ghat escarpment and north-south from north of Mumbai to north of Goa. The city Malvan is located in Sindhudurg district and bounded by three creeks viz., Karli, Kolamb, and Kalavli, of which Karli and Kalavli are the major rivers giving sediment input for this coast. The place is well known for the Sindhudurg Island Fort built by the Maratha King Shivaji during the 16th century and is crowded by tourists during the fair-weather season. The present study is a preliminary work and emerged while carrying out remote sensing application on the southern coast of Maharashtra. Hence, the present report does not have detailed in situ/field data. The remote sensing data provide significant information regarding physical setting, tectonic features, and coastal landforms, especially the large-scale morphological features such as beach ridges, spits, bars, islands, barrier beaches, and lagoons. In the present study, beach ridges and lineaments were observed along the Malvan coast and have been utilized to understand the evolution of the Malvan coast. Along with this, coastal erosion/accretion and landform/land cover classification have also been undertaken using remote sensing data.																	0749-0208					MAY	2008	24	3					672	694		10.2112/06-0692.1								WOS:000256120800012

A remote sensing analysis of coastal habitat composition for a threatened shorebird, the piping plover (Charadrius melodus)	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Most migrant shorebirds require coastal and estuarine habitat in the nonbreeding season and their overwinter survival is contingent upon the composition and quality of these winter sites. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between the distribution and abundance of the piping plover, a federally threatened and endangered shorebird, and its nonbreeding habitat along the Gulf of Mexico coastline. We identified sites consistently used by wintering piping plovers and quantified landscape and anthropogenic features within a subset of those locations. Using published literature, we documented that piping plovers consistently winter at 49 locations on the U.S. Gulf of Mexico coast (Marco Island, Florida to Padre Island, Texas). At 31 sites, we conducted a remote analysis of aerial photos for 11 features (e.g., intertidal area, urban area, beach). Linear regression was used to test correlations between plover abundance and landscape characteristics. We found that certain shoreline features (e.g., landform, inter-tidal area, total area) and measures of urbanization (e.g., urban area, length of roads) were significantly correlated, positively and negatively, respectively, with piping plover abundance across the Gulf of Mexico coastline. This information is critical to prevent or mitigate negative impacts of urbanization and subsequent coastal landscape change on shorebird populations.

The method is based on the Integral Equation Model (IEM) which predicts the normalized radar cross-section (MRCS) of randomly rough dielectric surfaces. The data used for this analysis were acquired in the German Bight of the North Sea by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-Band SAR (SIR-C/X-SAR) in 1994. In-situ measurements of the root-mean-squared (rms) height and the correlation length of the sand ripples clearly demonstrate a relationship between these roughness parameters and the C-band NRCS determined from an ERS SAR image. Using the IEM we have calculated NRCS isolines for the three frequency bands deployed by SIR-C/X-SAR (L, C, and X band), as a function of the rms height and the correlation length of the sand ripples. For each SIR-C/X-SAR image pixel these two roughness parameters were determined from the intersections of the NRCS isolines at different radar bands, and they were used for a crude sediment classification for a small test area at the German North Sea coast. Comparing our results with available sediment maps, we conclude that the presented method is very promising for tidal flat classification by using data from presently existing airborne and future spaceborne mufti-frequency SAR systems.

Ground-based measurements of spatial and temporal variability of snow accumulation in east Antarctica	REVIEWS OF GEOPHYSICS												The East Antarctic Ice Sheet is the largest, highest, coldest, driest, and windiest ice sheet on Earth. Understanding of the surface mass balance (SMB) of Antarctica is necessary to determine the present state of the ice sheet, to make predictions of its potential contribution to sea level rise, and to determine its past history for paleoclimatic reconstructions. However, SMB values are poorly known because of logistic constraints in extreme polar environments, and they represent one of the biggest challenges of Antarctic science. Snow accumulation is the most important parameter for the SMB of ice sheets. SMB varies on a number of scales, from small-scale features (sastrugi) to ice-sheet-scale SMB patterns determined mainly by temperature, elevation, distance from the coast, and wind-driven processes. In situ measurements of SMB are performed at single points by stakes, ultrasonic sounders, snow pits, and firn and ice cores and laterally by continuous measurements using ground-penetrating radar. SMB for large regions can only be achieved practically by using remote sensing and/or numerical climate modeling. However, these techniques rely on ground truthing to improve the resolution and accuracy. The separation of spatial and temporal variations of SMB in transient regimes is necessary for accurate interpretation of ice core records. In this review we provide an overview of the various measurement techniques, related difficulties, and limitations of data interpretation; describe spatial characteristics of East Antarctic SMB and issues related to the spatial and temporal representativity of measurements; and provide recommendations on how to perform in situ measurements.

Estimating the population size of an endangered shorebird, the Madagascar plover, using a habitat suitability model	ANIMAL CONSERVATION												The Madagascar plover Charadrius thoracicus is a shorebird endemic to western Madagascar, currently classified as globally vulnerable. It is restricted to specialized wetland habitats that are increasingly threatened by humans. To inform future conservation measures for this poorly known species, we develop a predictive habitat suitability map and use this map to estimate the size of the Madagascar plover population. We integrate spatially referenced presence-only observations of Madagascar plovers with Landsat data, elevation data and measures of distance to settlements and the coast to produce a habitat suitability model using ecological niche factor analysis. Validation of this model using a receiver operating characteristic plot suggests that it is at least 84% accurate in predicting suitable sites. We then use our estimate of total area of suitable habitat above a critical suitability threshold and data on Madagascar plover density in suitable sites to estimate the total population size to derive a total population estimate of 3100 +/- 396 standard error individuals. Finally, we explore the conservation applications of our model.

It is a major wetland complex on the Black Sea coast, which has a very rich biodiversity and critical habitat for globally endangered bird species, and was announced as an RAMSAR protection site in Turkey. Main objectives of this study were: (1) determination of the land use/cover changes, (2) examination of the effects of these changes on environment, and (3) assessment of the human impacts on the environment. 1987 Landsat TM and 2004 Aster images, topographic maps, field survey, and other ancillary data have been used to perform the study objectives. The obtained results delineated that the Kizilirmak Delta has been considerably changed as a result of human activities between 1987 and 2004. Analysis of satellite images and other data sources in the GIS environment introduced the changes in the delta and their impacts on the environment.

R.; Kang, Hyun-Suk			Validation of a multidecadal RCM hindcast over East Asia	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												The precipitation and low-level air temperature in East Asia from a regional climate model (RCM) hindcast for the 22-year period 1979-2000 is evaluated against observational data in preparation for the model use in regional climate change research. Emphasis of the evaluation is placed on the RCM capability in capturing the temporal and spatial variability of precipitation and low-level temperature, especially in conjunction with important climatological events such as, ENSO and East Asian monsoon, at three spatial scales of continental, subcontinental, and river basins. Spatial anomaly correlation time series of geopotential height and temperature show that the simulated upper-air fields remain consistent with the driving large-scale fields, NCEP Reanalysis 2 (R2), throughout the period. The simulated seasonal shifts in 850 hPa winds also agree well with R2 over eastern China and the western Pacific Ocean although the magnitudes of the shifts are overestimated, especially over the eastern slope of the Tibetan Plateau and in northern Manchuria. The simulated precipitation climatology agrees reasonably with that from two analysis datasets based on station- and remote-sensing data. Outstanding characteristics of precipitation including the location of the main rainband, climatological means, and the spatiotemporal variability in association with East Asian Monsoon, ENSO, and extreme events, are well represented in the hindcast. The most notable bias in the simulated precipitation is an overestimation of winter rainfall in southwestem coast of China, near the border with Vietnam. The simulation overestimates the interannual. variability of seasonal precipitation especially in southern China, however, the corresponding coefficients of variation agree reasonably with observations except in very dry regions. This suggests that climate sensitivity of scaled precipitation can be useful for projecting climate change signals. The simulated low-level temperature climatology agrees reasonably with observational data as well. The most noticeable biases in the simulated low-level temperature are the warm (cold) biases in southern Siberia (northeastern China) during winter (summer) and the systematic underestimation of low-level temperature in the Tibetan Plateau for all seasons. The daily maximum temperature is underestimated for all seasons by 2-3 K with the largest biases in spring and fall except in the northwestern Mongolia region where it has been overestimated during winter. The daily minimum temperature biases ranges from 0.3 K in spring to 2 K in winter, and are much smaller than those in daily maximum temperature. The evaluation of the multidecadal hindcast shows that model errors mostly confined in the region near the lateral boundaries of the model domain with only minor biases in eastern China. This allows us to be cautiously optimistic about the RCM usefulness for studies of precipitation and low-level temperature changes in East Asia induced by increased emissions of greenhouse gases.

Phytoplankton analysis revealed a near monospecific bloom of the dinoflagellate, Cochlodinium polykrikoides, with cell concentrations ranging from 2.5 x 10(5) to 3.2 x 10(6) cells per liter. Ground truth data were supplemented by processed satellite images from MODIS Aqua Level 2 data (1 km resolution) from January to April 2005, which revealed high surface chlorophyll-a levels (up to 50 mg/m(3)) offshore of west and southwest Palawan as early as February 2005. The bloom extended 310 km in length and 80 km in width at its peak in March off the central coast (Puerto Princesa). By April, the bloom declined in intensity, but was still apparent along the northern coast (El Nido). Fluctuations in chlorophyll levels off the western coast of Sabah, Malaysia and Brunei during this time period suggested that the bloom was not limited to the coast of Palawan. Satellite imagery from Sabah in late January revealed a plume of chl-a that is believed to be the source of the C polykrikoides bloom in Palawan. This plume drifted offshore, advected northward via the basin-wide counterclockwise gyre, and reached nutrient-rich, upwelled waters near Palawan (due to a positive wind stress curl) where the dinoflagellate bloomed and persisted for 2 months from March to April 2005.

Seasonal variations of chlorophyll a concentration in the northern South China Sea	IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS												Monthly climatology of chlorophyll a concentration (chl a) based on nine years of SeaWiFS data is used to illustrate seasonal variations and spatial structures in the northern South China Sea (SCS). Chl a starts to increase in September at the northern coast of Luzon Island, continues to increase in the autumn, and reaches its maximum in December or January. Maximum chl a is centered in the northern SCS off the northwestern coast of Luzon Island. Chl a starts to decrease gradually in February, and its values become very low from June to August. The region of elevated chl a during the winter bloom season is funnel shaped, with the narrow end at the northern coast of Luzon Island, where the chl a value is highest and opening toward the northwest. The sea surface temperature (SST) in this funnel-shaped region is significantly colder than SST in surrounding regions of the same latitude. The present study indicates that the winter blooms indicated by higher chl a and colder SST in the northern SCS are linked strongly to the local winter monsoon. The initial data exploration and analysis presented in this study was carried out using Giovanni, a state-of-the-art Web-based data analysis and visualization tool.																	1545-598X					APR	2008	5	2					315	319		10.1109/LGRS.2008.915932								WOS:000258766900042

Sand dune activity in north-eastern Patagonia	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												The Valdes Peninsula has the most noticeable aeolian landforms of the Patagonian drylands. The southern sector of the peninsula is affected by the advance of several fronts of active sand dunes grouped in discrete megapatches. The objectives of the study were to: (1) analyse the morphology of sand dunes, and (2) measure the migration rates and orientation of the sand dunes along a 33-year period (1969-2002). These studies used a series of field techniques in conjunction with aerial photography and satellite data, such as AVIRIS and Landsat imagery. Four main types of active sand dune forms were identified: (1) compound linear; (2) compound transverse; (3) compound dome-shaped; and (4) complex dome-shaped. Because of the windy climate, dune mobility is high; there is an eastward migration to an average speed of 9.1 +/- 2.7 m yr(-1). Despite this high rate and since observed changes in the total area of active dunes were small, active processes of vegetation encroachment are deducible. Thus, wind and effective rainfall appear as the main factors regulating the process, in short and long-term, respectively. Although the orientation and disposition of the dunefields is in agreement with the prevailing west winds, the active dunes present a variety of forms, which reflect local variations in the wind flow. The circulation is strongly influenced by the shape of the coastline and the actual existence of the dunefields is due to this friable windward coast found nowhere else in Patagonia.

These mudbanks are noticeable by their size (about 4 x 10(9) m(3) of sediment) and by the sediment dynamics they induce. Notably, visible remote sensing pictures present high turbid mud plume associated to mudbank erosion. The sediment transport is directly linked to the ambient forcing-littoral current, waves, and tide. In this paper, the turbid plume and the suspended mud transport around Guiana mudbanks are studied through a three-dimensional numerical study, under the three main different forcings. The study aims at describing the plume and the action of various physical processes in the suspended mud transport. The model results qualitatively agree with known observations issued from the literature. It is found that, the erosion-at the back of the bank-and the deposition-in front of the bank-could partly explain the migration process of these mudbanks. Waves are fundamental to create the erosion/deposition process, but littoral current and tide modulate it. Bottom flux and plume location vary with tide and these oscillations are accentuated during spring tide. In the same way, the wave incidence angle can explain the variability of erosion and deposition rate velocity along the Guiana coast. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Two stations (D1 and D2) were sampled on June 24, and D2 was resampled 6 days later; chlorophyll-a concentration had decreased by about one half. LAC MODIS-Chla images were obtained and showed the spread of the bloom on the day after sampling. The phytoplankton community consisted primarily of dinoflagellate temporary cysts, mainly at the surface and at 5 m in station D1. Two Pseudo-nitzschia species (P. australis, P. seriata) were also very abundant. Samples from the bloom had a specific phytoplankton absorption coefficient (a*(ph)(lambda)) lower than the rest of the samples. Values varied from 0.0186 to 0.0455 m(2) mg(-1) for a*(ph)(440) and from 0.0092 to 0.0294 m(2) mg(-1) for a*(ph) (675), with ratios a*(ph)(440): a*(ph)(675) ranging from 0.99 to 2.20. These low ratios were associated with the combined effect of packaging, and with the relatively high ratios of fucoxanthin, peridinin, diadinoxanthin and chlorophyll-c2 to TChla. Samples from the surface and 5 m depth at station D1 had higher ratios of Perid:TChla (0.12-0.32) than the rest of the samples, suggesting that cysts have similar Perid:TChla as free-living dinoflagellates. An unusual absorption spectrum with a broad maximum around 480-500 nm was associated with the high proportion of cysts and diatoms. The slope of the spectra between 443 and 488 nm was a good index to differentiate bloom samples containing high proportions of dinoflagellate temporary cysts. Further investigation of the absorption properties of dinoflagellate cysts is needed in order to detect these waters by remote sensing. Although much work is still necessary to understand and explain the bio-optical properties of a bloom, the present study is the first assessment off the Baja California coast to simultaneously consider aspects such as absorption properties, pigment composition and to include a spatial evaluation of the extension of a bloom with satellite images.

J	Huang, HM; Zhang, LQ; Guan, YJ; Wang, DH				Huang, Hua-Mei; Zhang, Li-Quan; Guan, Yu-Juan; Wang, Dong-Hui			A cellular automata model for population expansion of Spartina alterniflora at Jiuduansha Shoals, Shanghai, China	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Biological invasion has received considerable attention recently because of increasing impacts on local ecosystems. Expansion of Spartina alterniflora, a non-native species, on the intertidal mudflats of Jiuduansha Shoals at the Yangtze River Estuary is a prime example of a spatially-structured invasion in a relatively simple habitat, for which strategic control efforts can be modeled and applied. Here, we developed a Cellular Automata (CA) model, in conjunction with Remote Sensing and Geographical Information Systems, to simulate the expanding process of S. alterniflora for a period of 8 years after being introduced to the new shoals, and to study the interactions between spatial pattern and ecosystem processes for the saltmarsh vegetation. The results showed that the CA model could simulate the population dynamics of S. alterniflora and Phragmites australis on the Jiuduansha Shoals successfully. The results strongly support the hypothesis of space pre-emption as well as range expansion with simple advancing wave fronts for these two species. In the Yangtze River Estuary, the native species P. australis shares the same niche with the exotic species S. alterniflora. However, the range expansion rate of P. australis was much slower than that of S. alterniflora. With the accretion of the Jiuduansha Shoals due to the large quantity of sediments deposited by the Yangtze River, a rapid range expansion of S. alterniflora is predicted to last for a long period into future. This study indicated the potential for this approach to provide valuable insights into population and community ecology of invasive species, which could be very important for wetland biodiversity conservation and resource management in the Yangtze River Estuary and other such impacted areas.

The Absence of environmental planning in the process of land use development may cause many significant negative impacts on biodiversity, ecological value, and the general environmental conditions, and therefore, reducing such negative impacts will improve land use development. The first part of this sequel of two papers, which is part of a sustainable land use development research program, aims at designing a spatial framework to improve land use planning and development in an environmental context. The research program deals with the problem of land use planning and development in an and coastal area under environmentally sensitive conditions. The study area is El-Daba'a region, located in the northwestern coast of Egypt, which can be described as a wild area. The approach used in this paper consists of studying the spatial ecological characteristics of El-Daba'a region using different spatial data including maps and Landsat remote sensing data. These data are used to create a series of superimposed informative layers managed by a geographic information system (GIS) to describe the spatial ecological characteristics of the study area. The developed GIS allows decision makers to handle large amounts of information simultaneously such as geology, geomorphology, land cover, wild life and many other different information layers. The system is designed to help decision makers to organize, relate, analyze, and visualize the ecological data and information in the study area. The developed GIS system might be used to determine the probable effects of building a nuclear power station on the ecosystem.																	1015-4442					MAR-JUN	2008	26	1-2					95	106										WOS:000260151400010						
J	Lantuit, H; Pollard, WH				Lantuit, H.; Pollard, W. H.			Fifty years of coastal erosion and retrogressive thaw slump activity on Herschel Island, southern Beaufort Sea, Yukon Territory, Canada	GEOMORPHOLOGY					2nd Science Meeting of the European-Science-Foundation-Network-SEDIFLUX	JAN 20-22, 2005	Univ Clermont Ferrand, Clermont Ferrand, FRANCE	European Sci Fdn Network SEDIFLUX	Univ Clermont Ferrand			Patterns of coastal erosion in the Arctic differ dramatically from those coasts in more temperate environments. Thick sea ice and shore-fast ice limit wave-based erosional processes to a brief open water season, however despite this, permafrost coasts containing massive ice, ice wedges and ice-bonded sediments tend to experience high rates of erosion. These high rates of erosion reflect the combined thermal-mechanical processes of thawing permafrost, melting ground ice, and wave action. Climate change in the Arctic is expected to result in increased rates of coastal erosion due to warming permafrost, increasing active layer depths and thermokarst, rising sea levels, reduction in sea ice extent and duration, and increasing storm impacts. With the most ice-rich permafrost in the Canadian Arctic, the southern Beaufort Sea coast between the Tuktoyaktuk Peninsula and the Alaskan border is subject to high rates of erosion and retrogressive thaw slump activity. Under many climate change scenarios this area is also predicted to experience the greatest warming in the Canadian Arctic. This paper presents results of a remote sensing study on the long-term patterns of coastal erosion and retrogressive thaw slump activity for Herschel Island in the northern Yukon Territory. Using orthorectified airphotos from 1952 and 1970 and an Ikonos image from 2000 corrected with control points collected by kinematic differential global positioning system and processed using softcopy photogrammetric tools, mean coastal retreat rates of 0.61 m/yr and 0.45 m/yr were calculated for the periods 1952-1970 and 1970-2000, respectively. The highest coastal retreat rates are on north-west facing shorelines which correspond to the main direction of storm-related wave attack. During the period 1970-2000 coastal retreat rates for south to south-east facing shorelines displayed a distinct increase even though these are the most sheltered orientations. However, south to south-east facing shorelines correspond to the orientations where the highest densities of retrogressive thaw slumps are observed. Differences in rates of headwall retreat of retrogressive thaw slumps and coastal erosion results in the formation of larger thermokarst scars and the development of polycyclic thaw slumps on south to south-east exposures. The number and the total area of retrogressive thaw slumps increased by 125% and 160%, respectively, between 1952 and 2000. As well, the proportion of active retrogressive thaw slumps increased dramatically. Polycyclic retrogressive thaw slumps appear to develop in a periodic fashion, related to retrogressive thaw slump stage and maximum inland extent. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The southern part of the coast has a narrow shelf, but the north Orissa coast has an extended continental shelf. The coastline is bestowed with six major estuaries, India's second largest mangrove forest (Bhitarkanika Sanctuary), Asia's largest brackish water coastal lagoon (Chilika), extensive sandy beaches rich in heavy minerals, the world's largest rookery for the Olive Ridley sea turtle (Gahirmatha sandy beach within Bhitarkanika sanctuary), and two species of horseshoe crabs. In the last few decades there has been tremendous pressure on the coastal zone for the development of fisheries, aquaculture, ports, harbours, and urban settlements. These developments have led to environmental changes, some of which are irreversible, and thus have become issues of concern for the public as well as the state government. Some of the important environmental changes taking place, and which seriously affect the economy of the region, are tropical cyclones and associated storm surges, floods, decline in mangrove forests, accelerated shoreline changes, and transformation of the coastal lagoon ecosystem. This paper documents different coastal environmental features and their changes, observed during the last few decades through secondary data, field surveys, and remote sensing observations, and suggests a framework for a coastal zone management programme in the state.																	0749-0208					MAR	2008	24	2B		S			13	27		10.2112/04-0255.1								WOS:000254445500002

Collection altitude varied from 35 m to over 1 km, allowing determination of the sea surface mean square slope ( mss), the directional wave spectrum, and the detailed variation of backscattered power with incidence angle, which deviated from a simple Gaussian scattering model. The non-Gaussian characteristics of the backscatter increased systematically with the mss, suggesting that a global model to characterize Ka-band radar backscatter from the sea surface within 25 of nadir might be possible.

J	Sharma, N; D'Sa, E				Sharma, Neha; D'Sa, Eurico			Assessment and analysis of QuikSCAT vector wind products for the gulf of mexico: A long-term and hurricane analysis	SENSORS												The northern Gulf of Mexico is a region that has been frequently impacted in recent years by natural disasters such as hurricanes. The use of remote sensing data such as winds from NASA's QuikSCAT satellite sensor would be useful for emergency preparedness during such events. In this study, the performance of QuikSCAT products, including JPL's latest Level 2B (L2B) 12.5 km swath winds, were evaluated with respect to buoy-measured winds in the Gulf of Mexico for the period January 2005 to February 2007. Regression analyses indicated better accuracy of QuikSCAT's L2B DIRTH, 12.5 km than the Level 3 (L3), 25 km wind product. QuikSCAT wind data were compared directly with buoy data keeping a maximum time interval of 20 min and spatial interval of 0.1 (approximate to 10 km). R-2 values for moderate wind speeds were 0.88 and 0.93 for L2B, and 0.75 and 0.89 for L3 for speed and direction, respectively. QuikSCAT wind comparisons for buoys located offshore were better than those located near the coast. Hurricanes that took place during 2002-06 were studied individually to obtain regressions of QuikSCAT versus buoys for those events. Results show QuikSCAT's L2B DIRTH wind product compared well with buoys during hurricanes up to the limit of buoy measurements. Comparisons with the National Hurricane Center (NHC) best track analyses indicated QuikSCAT winds to be lower than those obtained by NHC, possibly due to rain contamination, while buoy measurements appeared to be constrained at high wind speeds. This study has confirmed good agreement of the new QuikSCAT L2B product with buoy measurements and further suggests its potential use during extreme weather conditions in the Gulf of Mexico.																	1424-8220					MAR	2008	8	3					1927	1949		10.3390/s8031927								WOS:000254340700034	27879803

The main potential vector of malaria in the Camargue area, the largest river delta in southern France, is the mosquito Anopheles hyrcanus ( Diptera: Culicidae). In the context of recent climatic and landscape changes, the evaluation of the risk of emergence or re-emergence of such a major disease is of great importance in Europe. When assessing the risk of emergence of vector-borne diseases, it is crucial to be able to characterize the arthropod vector's spatial distribution. Given that remote sensing techniques can describe some of the environmental parameters which drive this distribution, satellite imagery or aerial photographs could be used for vector mapping. Results: In this study, we propose a method to map larval and adult populations of An. hyrcanus based on environmental indices derived from high spatial resolution imagery. The analysis of the link between entomological field data on An. hyrcanus larvae and environmental indices (biotopes, distance to the nearest main productive breeding sites of this species i.e., rice fields) led to the definition of a larval index, defined as the probability of observing An. hyrcanus larvae in a given site at least once over a year. Independent accuracy assessments showed a good agreement between observed and predicted values (sensitivity and specificity of the logistic regression model being 0.76 and 0.78, respectively). An adult index was derived from the larval index by averaging the larval index within a buffer around the trap location. This index was highly correlated with observed adult abundance values (Pearson r = 0.97, p < 0.05). This allowed us to generate predictive maps of An. hyrcanus larval and adult populations from the landscape indices. Conclusion: This work shows that it is possible to use high resolution satellite imagery to map malaria vector spatial distribution. It also confirms the potential of remote sensing to help target risk areas, and constitutes a first essential step in assessing the risk of re-emergence of malaria in southern France.

J	West, JJ; Plug, LJ				West, J. J.; Plug, L. J.			Time-dependent morphology of thaw lakes and taliks in deep and shallow ground ice	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												The shape and depth of thaw lake basins depends on lake age, on whether the talik (thaw bulb) is at steady state, and on the distribution of ice in the ground. To investigate implications of this broad hypothesis, we use a numerical model of conductive heat transfer, phase change, and thaw subsidence of ice-rich sediment beneath a lake in cross section. For ground thermal properties with lake temperatures and dimensions consistent with measurements, modeled talik depth approximately increases with root time in lakes in deep ground ice which deepen more rapidly because of consolidation on thawing. In deep ground ice environments, basins achieve depths of approximate to 20 m in approximate to 5 ka. Expanding lakes with disequilibrium taliks have deep basins with broad, 100+ m wide, inclined margins. In shallow ground ice settings (either original epigenetic ice or in permafrost that has reformed in drained basins), lakes are < 3 m deep and flat bottomed. Unaffected by preexisting topography and ground ice variations, first-generation lakes in deep ground ice are rounder and grow larger in area than later-generation lakes. These predictions are consistent with GPS, sonar, and remote sensing measurements of bathymetry and plan view shape of first-and later-generation lakes in substrates with deep syngenetic ground ice (Pleistocene loess, northern Seward Peninsula, Alaska) and shallow epigenetic ice (Yukon Arctic coastal plain).																	0148-0227					FEB 9	2008	113	F1							F01009	10.1029/2006JF000696								WOS:000253066500001

Tundra lake changes from 1978 to 2001 on the Tuktoyaktuk Peninsula, western Canadian Arctic	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Landsat scenes spanning 1978-2001 were used to classify thermokarst lake area and determine changes in lake coverage on the Tuktoyaktuk Peninsula in northwestern Canada. Changes in total lake area between scenes were substantial, spanning a 14% increase and 11% decrease, mostly owing to changes in the area of lakes > 1.3 km(2) in area. Increases in total lake area occurred primarily between 1978-1992, and decreases between 1992-2001. Differences in total lake area between scenes from different years depend strongly on cumulative precipitation in the 12 month period preceding scene acquisition (r(2) = 0.82), and not on summer or mean annual air temperature (MAAT). Our results indicate that precipitation is the primary factor influencing the areal extent of lakes as detected by remote sensing. On the Tuktoyaktuk Peninsula, persistent lake area changes (if any) such as might occur by regional warming or changes in evaporation/precipitation balance over decades, are well-masked by short-term climatological changes.																	0094-8276					FEB 5	2008	35	3							L03502	10.1029/2007GL032303								WOS:000253063400005

Monitoring of the sediment dynamics along a sandy shoreline by means of airborne hyperspectral remote sensing and LIDAR: a case study in Belgium	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												Airborne hyperspectral data and airborne laserscan or LIDAR data were applied to analyse the sediment transport and the beach morphodynamics along the Belgian shoreline. Between 2000 and 2004, four airborne acquisitions were performed with both types of sensor. The hyperspectral data were classified into seven sand type classes following a supervised classification approach, in which feature selection served to reduce the number of bands in the hyperspectral data. The seven classes allowed us to analyse the spatial dynamics of specific sediment volumes. The technique made it possible to distinguish the sand used for berm replenishment works or for beach nourishments from the sand naturally found on the backshore and the foreshore. Subtracting sequential DTMs (digital terrain models) resulted in height difference maps indicating the erosion and accretion zones. The combination of both data types, hyperspectral data and LIDAR data, provides a powerful tool, suited to analyse the dynamics of sandy shorelines. The technique was demonstrated on three sites along the Belgian shoreline: Koksijde, located on the West Coast and characterized by wide accretional beaches, influenced by dry berm replenishment works and the construction of groins; Zeebrugge, on the Middle Coast, where a beach nourishment was executed one year before the acquisitions started and where the dams of the harbour of Zeebrugge are responsible for the formation of a large accretional beach, and Knokke-Heist, located on the East Coast and characterized by narrow, locally reflective, beaches, heavily influenced by nourishment activities. The methodology applied allowed retrieval of the main sediment transport directions as well as the amount of sediment transported. It proved to be specifically suited to follow up the redistribution and the re-sorting of the fill in beach nourishment areas. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Spectral investigations of the solar radiation during the total solar eclipse on March 29, 2006	JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS					International Symposium on Recent Observations and Simulations of the Sun-Earth System (ISROSES)	SEP 17-22, 2006	Varna, BULGARIA					We present results from examination of the dynamics and spectral distribution of the solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface during the total solar eclipse on March 29, 2006. The solar spectra were recorded using a multichannel spectrometer OCEAN USB2000 in 2048 spectral channels in the spectral range 350-1000 nm at a spectral resolution (halfwidth) of 1.5 nm. The spectral measurements were carried out between the 1st and 2nd and the 3rd and 4th contacts of the total solar eclipse from an observation point situated on the Mediterranean Sea coast, Antalya region, Turkey. The spectral data were evaluated using statistical methods such as the Student's t-criterion and others. The changes in dynamics of incident solar radiation intensity before and after eclipse totality were found to correlate (R approximate to 0.998) with the changes during the total Sun's eclipse on August 11, 1999, observed from an observation post on the line of totality situated on the Black Sea coast on Bulgarian territory. The changes in solar radiation measured before and after totality, within the absorption bands of water and oxygen, as well as along the spectra envelope, show statistically significant differences, which point to an unstable terrestrial atmosphere. Images from concurrent videometric observations proved that fine cloudy structures have appeared after totality in front of the solar disk.

J	Restrepo, JD; Lopez, SA				Restrepo, Juan D.; Lopez, Sergio A.			Morphodynamics of the Pacific and Caribbean deltas of Colombia, South America	JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES												This paper analyzes the physical factors controlling the recent morphology of major deltas along the Pacific and Caribbean coasts of Colombia. The study considers the fluvial, coastal, and oceanographic contributions to changes in delta morphology and uses different approaches, including (1) remote sensing techniques; (2) time series analysis of river discharge, sea level, wave climate and tidal variability; (3) analysis of the relationship between monthly mean sea level anomalies near the deltas related to the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO); (4) development of a database of key physical variables; (5) series of correlation calculations to examine which environmental factors control delta morphology; (6) analysis of shoreline changes for the 1986-2000 yr-period; and (7) classification of each delta system based on the relationship between water and sediment discharges and wave and tidal energies. Overall, Colombian deltas are built under destructive physical conditions. The Pacific deltas, San Juan, Mira, and Patia, are tide-influenced deltas although they exhibit definite characteristics of wave-dominated systems such as the presence of barriers and beach ridges. Also, these deltas exhibit the highest marine energy conditions of all Colombian deltas (marine power values between 9.1 and 11.6) due to the interplay of (1) moderate wave conditions as a result of the effect of swells from the SW with a significant height varying from 1.7 in the San Juan delta to 3.0 m and 3.1 m in the Mira and Patia deltas, respectively; (2) meso-tidal ranges; (3) steep subaqueous profiles; (4) low attenuation indexes of deep-water waves; and (5) strong oceanographic manifestations associated with the ENSO, causing regional sea level rises of 20-44 cm during El Nino events. The Caribbean deltas, Magdalena, Sinu and to a lesser extent, the Atrato, are wave-influenced deltas. The Magdalena, with deep and nearshore wave power values of 45 x 10(6) erg s(-1) and 35 x 10(6) erg s(-1) , respectively, and the lowest attenuation index of deep-water waves, is the most wave-influenced delta of Colombia. Statistical relationships show that the area of Colombian deltas is best predicted from average discharge and bank-full width of river entering the delta. The number of distributary channels is explained by the marine power index and the gradient of the delta plain. The average and total width of distributary channels are largely controlled by the tidal range. Further analysis of shoreline changes indicate that the retreating behavior of the western part of the Magdalena delta has been due to anthropogenic causes, including the construction of jetties in 1936. By contrast, processes of rapid erosion in the San Juan delta have been the result of 2.6 mm yr(-1) long-term relative sea level rise due to tectonic induced subsidence coupled with a eustatic rise of sea level. Overall, the other deltas are experiencing prograding phases with rates of accretion of 100 m yr(-1) in the artificial delta of the Canal del Dique. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

A last glacial ice sheet on the Pacific Russian coast and catastrophic change arising from coupled ice-volcanic interaction	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												Controversy exists over the extent of glaciation in Eastern Asia at the Last Glacial Maximum: complete ice sheet cover vs. restricted mountain icefields (an area discrepancy equivalent to 3.7 Greenland Ice Sheets). Current arguments favour the latter. However, significant last glacial ice-rafted debris (IRD) exists in NW Pacific ocean cores, which must have been sourced from a major ice sheet somewhere bordering the North Pacific. The origin of this IRD is addressed through a combination of marine core analysis, iceberg trajectory modelling and remote sensing of glacial geomorphology. We find compelling evidence for two stages of glaciation centred on the Kamchatka area of maritime southeast Russia during the last glacial, with ice extent intermediate in size between previous maximum and minimum reconstructions.

Furthermore, numerical experiments are conducted to gain understanding of the upwelling mechanisms. A tidal mixing front (TMF) is identified as the vital factor triggering the formation of the upwelling. The baroclinic pressure gradient force, which stems from the intense density difference across the TMF, causes a frontal-scale circulation at the TMF. As a result, upwelling appears as a branch of this circulation. The southwest monsoon induces downwelling, which competes with the front-induced upwelling. Climatologically, the upwelling dominates and can reach about 5 m below the sea surface above the slope bottom. In calm weather with no or weak winds, it is expected that the upwelling can reach all the way to the sea surface.																	0094-8276	1944-8007				JAN 18	2008	35	2							L02604	10.1029/2007GL032440								WOS:000252567200006						
J	Shan, G; Hu, W				Shan, Gao; Hu, Wang			Seasonal and spatial distributions of phytoplankton biomass associated with monsoon and oceanic environments in the South China Sea	ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA												Seasonal variations of phytoplankton/chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) distribution, sea surface wind, sea height anomaly, sea surface temperature and other oceanic environments for long periods are analyzed in the South China Sea (SCS), especially in the two typical regions off the cast coast of Vietnam and off the northwest coast of Luzon, using remote sensing data and other oceanographic data. The results show that seasonal and spatial distributions of phytoplankton biomass in the SCS are primarily influenced by the monsoon winds and oceanic environments. Off the east coast of Vietnam, Chl-a concentration is a peak in August, a jet shape extending into the interior SCS, which is associated with strong southwesterly monsoon winds, the coastal upwelling induced by offshore Ekman transport and the strong offshore current in the western SCS. In December, high Chl-a concentration appears in the upwelling region off the northwest coast of Luzon and spreads southwestward. Strong mixing by the strong northeasterly monsoon winds, the cyclonic circulation, southwestward coastal currents and river discharge have impacts on distribution of phytoplankton, so that the high phytoplankton biomass extends from the coastal areas over the northern SCS to the entire SCS in winter. These research activities could be important for revealing spatial and temporal patterns of phytoplankton and their interactions with physical environments in the SCS.																	0253-505X						2008	27	6					17	32										WOS:000263850400002

The dynamics of this Coupled ice-ocean system is important for both regional scale oceanography and large-scale global climate change research. A number of moorings were deployed in the area by JAMSTEC since 1992, and the data revealed highly variable characteristics of the hydrological environment. A regional high-resolution coupled ice-ocean model of the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas was established to simulate the ice-ocean environment and unique seasonal landfast ice in the coastal Beaufort Sea. The model results reproduced the Beaufort gyre and the ACC. The depth-averaged annual mean ocean Currents along the Beaufort Sea coast and shelf break compared well with data from four moored ADCPs, but the simulated velocity had smaller standard deviations, which indicate small-scale eddies were frequent in the region. The model results captured the seasonal variations Of sea ice area as compared with remote sensing data, and the simulated sea ice velocity showed an almost stationary area along the Beaufort Sea coast that was similar to the observed landfast ice extent. It is the combined effects of the weak oceanic current near the coast, a prevailing wind with an onshore component, the opposite direction of the ocean Current, and the blocking by the coastline that make the Beaufort Sea coastal areas prone to the formation of landfast ice.

Wayne			Relationships among water column toxins, cell abundance and chlorophyll concentrations during Karenia brevis blooms	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												The assumptions that Karenia brevis cell abundance and brevetoxin concentrations are proportional and that cell abundance and chlorophyll are related were tested in a 3-year field study off the west coast of Florida. The relationship between K. brevis cell abundance and brevetoxins (PbTx-2+PbTx-3) in whole water samples was strong (R-2 = 0.92). There was no significant difference between the brevetoxin concentrations in whole water and the > 0.7 mu m particulate fraction. Only 7% of the total brevetoxin concentration was measured in the < 0.7 mu m (cell free) filtrate. The relationship of K. brevis cell abundance > 5000 cells L-1 with chlorophyll for all cruises and at all depths was robust (R-2 = 0.78). These data substantiate the use of chlorophyll as a proxy for K. brevis cell abundance and K. brevis cell abundance as a proxy for brevetoxins during blooms. The ratios of the brevetoxins, PbTx-2:PbTx-3, was significantly higher in surface water than in bottom water. This information in conjunction with K. brevis growth rates may provide a useful indicator for determining the physiological state of the bloom over time. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Hydrodynamic accumulation of Karenia off the west coast of Florida	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												Blooms of the toxic dinoflagellates, Karenia spp. occur nearly annually in the eastern Gulf of Mexico with cell abundances typically > 10(5) cells L-1. Thermal and ocean color satellite imagery shows sea surface temperature patterns indicative of upwelling events and the concentration of chlorophyll at fronts along the west Florida continental shelf. Daily cell counts of Karenia show greater increases in cell concentrations at fronts than can be explained by Karenia's maximum specific growth rate. This is observed in satellite images as up to a 10-fold greater increase in chlorophyll biomass over 1-2 d periods than can be explained by in situ growth. In this study, we propose a model that explains why surface blooms of Karenia may develop even when nutrients on the west Florida shelf are low. In the summer, northward winds produce a net flow east and southeast bringing water and nutrients from the Mississippi River plume onto the west Florida shelf at depths of 20-50 m. This water mass supplies utilizable inorganic and organic forms of nitrogen that promote the growth of Karenia to pre-bloom concentrations in sub-surface waters in the mid-shelf region. In the fall, a change to upwelling favorable winds produces onshore transport. This transport, coupled with the swimming behavior of Karenia, leads to physical accumulation at frontal regions near the coast, resulting in fall blooms. Strong thermal fronts during the winter provide a mechanism for re-intensification of the blooms, if Karenia cells are located north of the fronts. This conceptual model leads to testable hypotheses on bloom development throughout the Gulf of Mexico.

It mainly affects the coastal zone adjacent to areas of dense population. To detect the sources of pollution along this zone as well as to identify their characteristics, remote sensing data was used. Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and Landsat 7 ETM+ satellite images, which have high spatial resolution, were analyzed using different types of software for discriminating polluted water in the marine environment. Different optical and digital advantages in these programs were applied to reveal anomalous features on satellite images. Subsequently, the identified features of pollution were verified in the field with bacterial analysis conducted at selected sites. Results showed 82 major, permanent sources of pollution (termed hotspots) along the Lebanese coast. More than 73% of these sources are attributed to discharges from wastewater, chemicals, and oil residues.																	1527-5922						2008	9	2-3					205	214		10.1080/15275920802122296								WOS:000257013900012

Remotely sensed spawning habitat of Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax) and Northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax) within the California Current	FISHERIES OCEANOGRAPHY												We use trivariate kernel density estimation to define spawning habitat of northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax) and Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax) in the California Current using satellite data and in situ egg samples from the Continuous Underway Fish Egg Sampler (CUFES) deployed during surveys in April by the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI). Observed egg distributions were compared with monthly composite satellite sea surface temperature (SST) and surface chlorophyll a (chl a) data. Based on the preferred spawning habitat, as defined in SST and chl a space, the satellite data were used to predict potential spawning habitat along two areas of the west coast of North America. Data from the southern area (21.5 to 39 degrees N) were compared to observations from the CUFES data for the period 1998-2005. Northern anchovy and Pacific sardine exhibited distinctly different spawning habitat distributions. A significant relationship was found between satellite-based spawning area and that measured during surveys for sardine. CUFES area estimated for sardine was similar in magnitude to that estimated from satellite data (similar to 60 000 km(2)). In contrast, spawning habitat of anchovy averaged between 1000 and 200 000 km(2) for the period 1998-2005, for CUFES and satellite estimates, respectively. Interannual variability in the area (km(2)) and duration (months) of estimates of suitable habitat varied between species and between the northern (39 to 50.5 degrees N) and southern portions of the California Current. Long-term monitoring of habitat variability using remote sensing data is possible in the southern portion of the California Current, and could be improved upon in the northern area with the addition of surveys better timed to describe relationships between observed and estimated spawning habitats.																	1054-6006						2008	17	2					126	136		10.1111/j.1365-2419.2008.00469.x								WOS:000254413700006

Trends in the fishery are evaluated using FAO data, acoustic surveys, and catch statistics from the EU fleet (1996-2006). Remote sensing data demonstrate rising annual sea surface temperatures, up to 3 degrees C higher than the long-term average in 2002-2003, following a shift in ocean climate in 1995. Fish abundance and repeated expansion of the sardinella population in the past 10 years are attributed to favorable oceanographic conditions and increased recruitment success. Sardinella thrives with intense upwelling and high primary production during spring, and retention of waters over the shelf during summer and autumn. The stock of S. aurita over the Northwest African shelf oscillates with the cold-warm states of the habitat. Favorable hydrographic conditions and extended habitat has resulted in unprecedented rise of sardinella abundance in the late 1990s, which was counterbalanced by the impact of fisheries. A backshift to a cold-state ecosystem, with extensive regional upwelling and decreased sardinella habitat, would topple that balance. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The coastal zone in this direction has considerably changed due to open mining activities since 1980. Forest areas and sand dunes have been destroyed by open mining activities performed due to lack of environmental precautions. As a result of filling of the sea with materials extracted from open mining areas, ecosystem and topographic structure were totally damaged. In this study, the coastal changes that occurred in the selected region being under the influence of human-induced activities and coastal erosion along, the West Black Sea Coast of Turkey in the vicinity of Istanbul are analyzed by using the surface profiles generated through utilizing Landsat satellite images belonging to various years, to-ether with bathymetric and Standard topographic maps of scale 1/25 000. The findings are investigated in detail for each transect, and, consequently, it has become clear that severe changes have occurred within 1984 and 2001. The sea had been filled with the excavated material from the open mining areas from 1984 till 1992, however, the trend reversed afterwards till 2001. That coastal erosion had been highly experienced, and materials filled in the sea environment had been lost.

Multispectral and hyperspectral analysis and modelling of the absorbance characteristics of marine algal pigments	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The techniques of remote sensing in spectral bands and hyperspectral remote sensing were modelled with laboratory experiments on marine algal pigments obtained from four species of green micro-algae of the eastern coast of India. The spectral absorbance was measured within the visible range of wavelength for chlorophyll mixtures of different concentrations and also for chromatographically separated pigments. The intention was to simulate and compare the expected nature of results obtained with remote sensing in wavebands and hyperspectral sensing involving a fine resolution in wavelength. Therefore, the absorbance was measured both with filters of three different visible spectral bands, viz. blue, green, and red, and with a continuous scan of wavelength. The algal species were distinguishable with both types of measurements. However, the hyperspectral technique was found to be more suitable in revealing the individual contribution of pigments. Based on the experimental results, a computational model was developed with Gaussian variation of absorbance as a function of wavelength. The experimental results were simulated with that model explaining the comparative spectroscopic results obtained from band and hyperspectral sensing.																	0143-1161	1366-5901					2008	29	3					787	799		10.1080/01431160701311275								WOS:000252346800010

The role of digital bathymetry in mapping shallow marine vegetation from hyperspectral image data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Hyperspectral remote sensing is a proven technology for measurement of coastal ocean colour, including sea-bed mapping in optically shallow waters. Using hyperspectral imagery of shallow (<15m deep) sea bed acquired with the Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI-550), we examined how changes in the spatial resolution of bathymetric grids, created from sonar data (echosounding) and input to conventional image classifiers, affected the accuracy of distributional maps of invasive (Codium fragile ssp. tomentosoides) and native (kelp) seaweeds off the coast of Nova Scotia, Canada. The addition of a low-resolution bathymetric grid, interpolated from soundings by the Canadian Hydrographic Service, improved the overall classification accuracies by up to similar to 10%. However, increasing the bathymetric resolution did not increase the accuracy of classification maps produced with the supervised (Maximum Likelihood) classifier as shown by a slightly lower accuracy (2%) when using an intermediate-resolution bathymetric grid interpolated from soundings with a recreational fish finder. Supervised classifications using the first three eigenvectors from a principal-components analysis were consistently more accurate (by at least 27%) than unsupervised (K-means classifier) schemes with similar data compression. With an overall accuracy of 76%, the most reliable scheme was a supervised classification with low-resolution bathymetry. However, the supervised approach was particularly sensitive, and variations in accuracy of 2% resulted in overestimations of up to 53% in the extent of C. fragile and kelp. The use of a passive optical bathymetric algorithm to derive a high-resolution bathymetric grid from the CASI data showed promise, although fundamental differences between this grid and those created with the sonar data limited the conclusions. The bathymetry (at any spatial resolution) appeared to improve the accuracy of the classifications both by reducing the confusion among the spectral classes and by removing noise in the image data. Variations in the accuracy of depth estimates and inescapable positional inaccuracies in the imagery and ground data largely accounted for the observed differences in the classification accuracies. This study provides the first detailed demonstration of the advantages and limitations of integrating digital bathymetry with hyperspectral data for the mapping of benthic assemblages in optically shallow waters.

Sediment concentration and bed form structures of Gulf of Cambay from remote sensing	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The continental shelf on the west coast of India is the widest off Mumbai and leads to a strongly converging channel, the Gulf of Cambay (GoC). Tides in this Gulf are the largest on the Indian coast. The flow-generated bed forms are significant features in the Gulf of Cambay region, and their presence depends on strong tidal or other currents, capable of moving the sand and also on the availability of sand. Digital data collected onboard Indian Remote sensing satellites IRS-1C and IRS-P4OCM (Ocean Colour Monitor), covering the GoC region was digitally processed. False colour composites (FCC) of IRS-1C were generated and used to map coastal, near-shore geomorphic features and underwater flow-generated bed form structures. Suspended sediment concentration and their dispersal patterns were studied by processing IRS-P4 data. The impact of high tides on the suspended sediment concentration and sediment flow pattern was studied to understand the mechanism of sediment flow. Based on the suspended sediment concentration, flow structures, geomorphic features and hydrodynamics, it is concluded that fine-grained sediments are transported to the inner Gulf, whereas, sandy sediments are transported south-westwards and outwards of Gulf of Cambay. These sediments, perhaps participate in the formation of bed form structures.																	0143-1161						2008	29	8					2169	2182		10.1080/01431160701422221								WOS:000254348100001

Uplift and subsidence due to the 26 December 2004 Indonesian earthquake detected by SAR data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The Indonesian earthquake took place on 26 December 2004 at 00:58 GMT (moment magnitude 9.3) in the Indian Ocean, offshore the west coast of Sumatra, at a depth of about 30km. This earthquake is one of the largest of the past 100 years, comparable only with those in Chile (1960) and Alaska (1964). The earthquake originated in the subduction zone of the Indian and Burma plates, moving at a relative velocity of 6cm/year. The aftershocks were distributed along a plate boundary of about 1000-1300km between Sumatra and the Andaman Islands. Some hours after the earthquake a destructive tsunami followed and hit the coastlines of the surrounding regions, causing widespread destruction in Indonesia, India, Thailand and Sri Lanka. The European Space Agency (ESA) made available a data package composed of European Remote Sensing Satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (ERS-SAR) and Environment Satellite Advanced SAR (ENVISAT-ASAR) data covering the affected area, acquired before (four acquisition dates) and after (five acquisition dates) the earthquake. A total of 26 frames were analysed. We used this dataset to evaluate the effects of the earthquake and tsunami on the human settlements and the physiographic conditions along the coast. The proposed method is based on a visual comparison between pre- and post-seismic SAR intensity images, and on an analysis of their correlation coefficients. No complex data were made available by the ESA to exploit phase coherence. Analysis of pre- and post-earthquake SAR backscattering showed wide uplift areas between the Andaman Islands and Simeulue Island, and large modifications of the coastline of Sumatra. Subsiding areas were detected along the southeast coast of Andaman up to the west coast of Nicobar Island. Tidal effects were filtered out of the SAR images to identify the consequences of the earthquake. Global Positioning System (GPS) stations in the Andaman provided results confirming the surface displacement pattern detected by SAR. The analysis enabled us to draw a boundary line separating the uplift and subsidence.

DEM and bathymetry estimation for mapping a tide-coordinated shoreline from fine spatial resolution satellite sensor imagery	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Fine spatial resolution remotely sensed imagery has considerable potential for mapping a shoreline. Although fine spatial resolution imagery typically allows the instantaneous shoreline to be mapped with high accuracy, interest is normally focused on a reference shoreline, defined on a stable vertical datum, which is generally not apparent in the imagery unless acquired at a time carefully coordinated with the tidal characteristics of the region. To map a tidecoordinated shoreline, such as the mean sea level ( MSL), information on terrain topography, bathymetry and tidal characteristics is required. In this study, IKONOS imagery was used to derive topographic and bathymetric information for an extract of the Malaysian coast and combined with a tide chart for the region to map the MSL. The digital elevation model ( DEM) derived had a root mean square error ( RMSE), calculated on independent control points, of,2.2m while the bathymetric model had an RMSE of 0.87 m. The shoreline derived from the combination of the DEM, bathymetry and tidal information was mapped with an RMSE of 1.8 m.																	0143-1161						2008	29	15					4515	4536		10.1080/01431160802029685								WOS:000258457200011

Ramalingeswara			Seasonal and interannual variability of sea surface chlorophyll a concentration in the Arabian Sea	JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING												Seasonal and interannual variability of chlorophyll a concentration along the West Coast of India (WCI) was detected spatially by ocean colour satellite remote sensing during 1998-2003. Start timing of the summer bloom was different spatially. The summer bloom started Trivendrum in May, along Cochin coast in June, northward of it in July and also showed interannual variability that corresponding with the wind speed in the area. Summer bloom in 1998 and 2002 appeared about two weeks earlier than in 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2003, and it corresponded with weak winds that can lead to an early development of the thermocline. The bloom was late in 1999 and 2001 at Trivendrum and along the Cochin coast, and in the northern are in 2000. It corresponded with stronger wind stress that delayed seasonal thermocline formation. The winter bloom appeared from early October to last week of January, and it did not have a clear temporal transition. The area where chlorophyll a concentration exceeds 5 mg/m(3) was wider in northern area than in the southern area of the WCI every year. The magnitude of winter bloom was different between years, but it did not show a relation with average wind speed in winter. Those results indicated that the timing of the seasonal bloom along the WCI is largely affected by the variability of global climate such as El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events.

A remote sensing study of the phytoplankton spatial-temporal cycle in the south eastern Indian Ocean	JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING												Data from the Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS) was used to study the abundance and variability of chlorophyll a in the southeastern Indian Ocean, an interesting region because it includes the Indonesian through-flow and the anomalous Leeuwin Current. This study is the first to interpret the CZCS observations in terms of the spatial-temporal variability of this large area. The period of data (1979 to 1986) covered the full cycle (pre, during and post) of a major El Nino event, which has yet to be done by the more recent ocean color sensors. The highest seasonal mean chlorophyll a concentrations along the NorthWest Shelf of Australia occurred in Summer (January-March) and in coastal areas off south-western Australia in Autumn (April-June). Concentrations in the offshore oceanic regions were mostly poor. Exceptions to this occurred in proximity to the adjacent Indonesian islands and directly south of Albany (possibly due to northwards flow of subantarctic nutrient-rich waters). A considerable interannual variation was also noted, with the highest mean chlorophyll a concentrations occurring in 1981, 1982 and 1983.																	1931-3195						2008	2								023510	10.1117/1.2902340								WOS:000264046200016

Statistical techniques for correlating total suspended matter concentration with seawater reflectance using multispectral satellite data	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												The transport and distribution of sediments driven by mechanisms such as tides and waves, river discharges, wind stress, and turbidity currents and the sediment transport effects can be studied by remote sensing techniques. The study of total suspended matter concentration has ecological importance since it is the main carrier of various inorganic and organic processes. The main objective of this work was to evaluate the performance of different statistical methodologies in the estimation of total suspended matter concentration, in the breaking zone and in its adjacent area, using multispectral satellite images from TERRA/ASTER, SPOT/HRVIR, and Landsat/TM. These images cover a particular area of the northwest coast of Portugal. The relationship between the total suspended matter concentration and the spectral response of the seawater, in the visible and near-infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, was quantified through simulations on different beaches of the study area. Seven images of TERRA/ASTER, SPOT/HRVIR, and Landsat/TM sensors were calibrated and atmospherically and geometrically corrected. Linear single-band models, linear multiple regressions, and artificial neural networks were applied to the visible and near-infrared bands of these sensors in order to estimate the total suspended matter concentration. Statistical analysis using determination coefficients and error estimation was employed, aiming to evaluate the most accurate approach in the estimation of total suspended matter concentration. The analysis of the root-mean-square error achieved by both linear and nonlinear models supports the hypothesis that the relationship between seawater reflectance and total suspended matter concentration is clearly nonlinear. Artificial neural networks have been shown to be useful in estimating the total suspended matter concentration from reflectance of visible and near-infrared bands with images of ASTER, HRVIR, and TM sensors, with better results for ASTER and HRVIR sensors. The artificial neural network approach was further applied to the seven processed images, and maps of total suspended matter concentration for all satellite images processed were produced.

Evolution and performance of beach fill at Ennore Seaport, southeast coast of India	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												The seaport at Ennore north of Chennai on the southeast coast of India was built in the year 2000 as an additional facility to the existing main port. An important aspect of the newly built port was protection from the erosion and accretion processes so very characteristic of this region. With a view to preventing downdrift; erosion, artificial beach nourishment-a soft engineering measure-was provided by placing dredged material north of the port. This paper discusses performance of the beach fill and consequent shoreline oscillations on the adjacent coast caused by the creation of the new port. A combination of remote sensing based data, field surveys, and numerical models was used to (i) quantify the impact of the port on adjacent areas and (ii) assess performance of beach fill. Based on beach profile (planform) analysis for the period March 1999-December 2004 for the I-km coast on either side of the port, it was noticed that the southern coast is accreting at a rate of 44 m/y while the northern coast is eroding at a rate of 46 m/ y. Beach fill, 1000 m long and 500 m wide (avg.) with a transition length of 500 m at the northern end, underwent erosion, with 1.43 X 10(6) m(3) of fill material lost between 2000 and 2004, against a total beach fill of 3.5 X 10(6) m(3). Numerical simulations were conducted with near-shore wave climate derived from the parabolic wave transformation model, which indicated that beach fill was lost for 3 y considering the present rate of erosion. The presence of coarser sediments with positive skewness at the beach fill region is suggestive of favorable conditions for longevity of fill, and simulations conducted with increased transition length yielded better results in terms of performance of beach fill.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				JAN	2008	24	1A		S			232	243		10.2112/05-0537.1								WOS:000252701100025

Ontogenetic patterns of habitat use by reef-fish in a Marine Protected Area network: a multi-scaled remote sensing and in situ approach	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												A network of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) on the west coast of the island of Hawaii (West Hawaii) has been shown to vary in its effectiveness to replenish depleted aquarium fish stocks. To determine the abundance and distribution of habitats needed to better design and manage MPAs in Hawaii, underwater video transects, remote sensing data and a benthic classification scheme were combined to develop a map of reef habitats previously identified as important to the life history of aquarium fish and other reef species. Using these maps, an assessment was conducted to quantify habitat use by different life history stages of the most commonly live-caught aquarium fish, the yellow tang Zebrasoma flavescens, in existing MPAs. Rugosity, small reef features (i.e. percent cover of dominant reef species) and the abundance and size of fish were quantified in 1 15 circular plots to determine the accuracy of mapping efforts and the distribution of fish life history stages across the reef in 4 MPAs. Visual classification and mapping of habitat types was 93% accurate and consistent with percent cover of substrates quantified at the quadrat level. The different life history stages of yellow tangs were distributed along distinct habitat types in all of the MPAs examined. New recruits and juveniles of the yellow tang showed similar patterns of habitat use among sites and were associating with coral-rich areas and patches of the finger coral Porites compressa. In contrast, the distribution and abundance of adults varied greatly within and among sites. The development of a ground-truthed habitat map allowed a holistic examination of habitat use by yellow tang, including most life history stages, which provides key information for the design of MPAs and the advancement of ecosystem-based management.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2008	365						217	232		10.3354/meps07492								WOS:000259379600019

Generalised model of primary production in the southern Benguela upwelling system	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												We provide a proof-of-concept demonstration using a novel method for estimating depth-integrated distributions of chlorophyll from archives of data from ships, buoys or gliders combined with remotely sensed data of sea surface temperature (SST) and surface chlorophyll a (chl a) from satellites. Our area of application has contrasting hydrographic regimes, which include the dynamic southern Benguela upwelling system and the stratified waters of the Agulhas Bank, South Africa. The method involves using self-organising maps (SOMs), a type of artificial neural network, to identify 'typical' chl a profiles regardless of their statistical form, provided several of a similar shape have been found in the training set. These are arranged in a linear array, ranging from uniform profiles low in chl a to profiles with high surface or subsurface peaks. We then use generalised modelling to relate these characteristic profiles to remotely sensed surface features, viz. surface chl a and SST, as well as area, season, and water depth (a proxy for distance offshore). The model accounts for 87% of the variability in chl a profile and is used to predict the type of profile likely for each pixel in monthly remote sensing composites of SST and surface chl a and then to estimate integrated chl a and primary production with the aid of a light model. Primary production peaks in mid-summer, reaching 5 mgC m(-2) d(-1) locally, with an average over the whole area and all seasons of 1.4 mg C m(-2) d(-1). Seasonal variation is greatest in the southern part of the west coast, and lowest in the stratified southeast. Annual primary production for the southern Benguela region including the Agulhas Bank is ca. 156 million tC yr(-1). This is the most robust estimate of primary production in the Benguela system to date because it combines the spatial and temporal coverage provided by remote sensing with realistic vertical chl a profiles.

Multivariate Prediction of Rockfish Habitat Suitability in Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary and Del Monte Shalebeds, California, USA	MARINE GEODESY					104th Annual Meeting of the Association-of-American-Geographers	APR 07, 2008	Boston, MA					Due to the decline of fisheries throughout the world, there is an ever-increasing demand among fisheries managers for more and better data regarding the distribution and abundance of commercially important fishes. Along the Pacific coast of North America, there are insufficient stock data for most rockfish species, which compose one of the most valuable commercial and recreational fisheries in California. One approach being explored for increasing our understanding of fish distribution patterns and potentially generating stock assessment data over large areas is the use of habitat-based assessment. The general hypothesis is that because rockfish are not randomly distributed across habitats, it should be possible to model and predict their distribution and abundance based on habitat maps and biological data. Furthermore, to the extent that these models are robust and portable, they should be applicable across a variety of locations and physical settings. We attempt to test these hypotheses using predictive models created for two species of rockfish [Sebastes flavidus (yellowtail) and S. rosaceus (rosy)] within Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary (CBMNS). These models, created as part of a recent study, were applied to and tested against distribution data from a previous study of the two species in question at Del Monte shalebeds in Monterey Bay, California. The general linear models (GLMs) were created using rugosity, slope, aspect, depth, and topographic position index analyses of bathymetric digital elevation along with presence/absence data for the two species of rockfish. The model for S. flavidus generated at CBNMS proved to be at least as efficient at predicting yellowtail rockfish distribution at Del Monte as in the setting in which it was created, while the model for S. rosaceus failed to predict rosy rockfish distribution at Del Monte with any reliability.

Inundation mapping - a study based on December 2004 Tsunami Hazard along Chennai coast, Southeast India	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Tsunami impact study has been undertaken along Chennai coast starting from Pulicat to Kovalam. The study area Chennai coast is mainly devoted to prepare large scale action plan maps on tsunami inundation incorporating land use details derived from satellite data along with cadastral data using a GIS tool. Under tsunami inundation mapping along Chennai coast an integrated approach was adopted to prepare thematic maps on land use/land cover and coastal geomorphology using multispectral remote sensing data. The RTK dGPS instruments are used to collect elevation contour data at 0.5 m intervals for the Chennai coast. The GIS tool has been used to incorporate the elevation data, tsunami inundation markings obtained immediately after tsunami and thematic maps derived from remote sensing data. The outcome of this study provides an important clue on variations in tsunami inundation along Chennai coast, which is mainly controlled by local geomorphologic set-up, coastal zone elevation including coastal erosion protection measures and near shore bathymetry. This study highlights the information regarding most vulnerable areas of tsunami and also provides indication to demarcate suitable sites for rehabilitation.																	1561-8633						2008	8	4					617	626										WOS:000259988700002

Narendra			Mapping, monitoring and conservation of Mahanandi wetland ecosystem, Orissa, India using remote sensing and GIS	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES INDIA SECTION B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Mangrove forests are important component of coastal wetland ecosystems, depleting rapidly from nature due to anthropogenic pressure. The present study deals with periodic assessment and monitoring of the mangroves of Mahanadi delta, Orissa using remote sensing and Geographic Information System techniques. Satellite data of Landsat PASS for 1973, Landsat TM for 1990 and IRS P6 LISS III for 2004 were used to find out the changes that occurred in mangrove and other land cover categories during last 30 years. It was found that the delta is occupied by dense mangrove (12.6%), open mangrove (3.3%), aquaculture (12.9%) and agriculture (30.9%) in 2004. A loss of 2606 ha mangrove area and an increase of 3657 ha aquaculture area clearly depict high anthropogenic activities by local villagers. A significant increase of 726 ha plantations illustrates plantation activities taken up by the Orissa Forest Department to protect the coastal shoreline.																	0369-8211						2008	78						81	89										WOS:000262100200008

The city has been undergoing rapid growth due to increasing oil revenues leading to a sustained economic growth of the country. This has further enhanced a rapid population growth of the city from both internal migration and influx of foreign workers. The population of Doha City reached 45.6% of the total population of Qatar in 2004. During the Nineties, the State of Qatar initiated a number of infrastructural projects that included a large scale dredging and reclamation activities along the coastal areas of Doha. This research aims to use Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) techniques to investigate the rapid urbanization rates and its effect on land use patterns along the costal areas of Doha, as well as to detect the changes that took place in land use types within the city administrative boundaries. Data sources for the study included satellite images (Landsat (1) MSS dated 3/9/1972; Landsat (5) TM dated 28/2/1986; and Landsat (7) ETM+ dated 22/1/2002), field visits and surveys of the coastal areas, and information from technical reports and assessments available from Governmental Departments of Doha City. Using the landsat data, a set of the matic maps were developed to present the net increase in Doha City total area due to dredging and reclamation activities along the city coastline between 1972-2002, as well as a set of maps showing various land use categories of land use types. These included: Vegetation area, Vacant area, Sabkhat, Sandy area, Shallow coastal water, and Urban built area. The output of the application of GIS techniques using 1972, 1986, and 2002 land use maps indicated that the net increase in the coastal areas of the city due to reclamation and dredging activities was 10 Km(2) during the period 1972-2002, and the changes that took place during the period 1986-2002 in the land use categories were: Vegetation (green) area decreased by about 1.6 Km(2), Vacant area by 37.36 Km(2), an indication of the rapid transfer of land in Doha. On the other hand, Sabkhat area decreased by about 5.32 Km(2), while the Urban (built) area within the established city administrative boundaries has increased by about 34.5 Km(2), The main recommendations of the study are the use of Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques in monitoring land use changes within the city administrative boundaries, as well as the reclamation and dredging activities along the coastal areas, and to use the results for future urban planning; to plan and protect the sensitive costal ecosystems during the reclamation and dredging activities; and conducting enviromental impact assessment studies for new projects and implementation of integrated coastal zone management.																	1015-4442					DEC	2007	25	4					190	198										WOS:000256160100006

Various monitoring stations for spectral reflectance measurements and sand sampling stations for moisture content analyses were selected on each of the beaches. The sand samples were further sieved in the laboratory to obtain the grain size distribution. The spectral reflectance measurements of the beaches and the grain size distributions were compared with the classified IKONOS satellite images obtained simultaneously with the field surveys. Reflectance values showed similarities between the beaches. Classification done by using the grain size distributions put forth the areal-based information on sand size characteristics.

Coastline change detection using remote sensing	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Coast is a unique environment in which atmosphere, hydrosphere and lithosphere con tact each other. Coastline is one of the most important linear features on the earth's surface, which display a dynamic nature. Coastal zone, and its environmental management requires the information about coastlines and their changes. This paper examines the Current methods of coastline change detection using satellite images. Based on the advantages and drawbacks of the methods, a new procedure has been developed. The proposed procedure is based on a combination of histogram thresholding and band ratio techniques. The Study area of the project is Urmia Lake; the 20(th) largest, and the second hyper saline lake in the world. In order to assess the accuracy of the results, they have been compared with ground truth observations. The accuracy of the extracted coastline has been estimated as 1.3 pixels (pixel size=30 m). Based on this investigation, the area of the lake has been decreased approximately 1040 square kilometers from August 1998 to August 2001. This result has been verified through TOPEX/Posidon satellite information that indicates a height variation of three meters.

Shoreline mapping from coarse-spatial resolution remote sensing imagery of Seberang Takir, Malaysia	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												The coastal zone is under considerable pressure from development and is subject to change. Consequently, shoreline monitoring has grown in importance. Remotely sensed imagery from satellite sensors has been used as an alternative to conventional methods, such as those based on the interpretation of aerial photography and ground-based surveying, for monitoring shoreline position. However, the accuracy of shoreline mapping from satellite sensor imagery has been limited because of the relatively coarse spatial resolution (>10 m) of the sensors commonly used. Because of major practical and financial constraints, very fine spatial resolution (<5 m) data are often impractical for mapping large stretches of shoreline, so refinement of image analysis methods are needed to extract the desired subpixel-scale information from relatively coarse spatial resolution imagery. In this paper, the potential to map the shoreline at a subpixel scale from a soft classification of relatively coarse spatial resolution satellite sensor imagery was evaluated. Unlike conventional approaches, the methods used allowed the shoreline to be mapped within image pixels and have the potential to yield an accurate and realistic prediction of shoreline location. The approach involved the use of a soft image classification to estimate the subpixel-scale thematic composition of image pixels, which were then located geographically through postclassification analysis. Specifically, a contouring and geostatistical method based on a two-point histogram was used to position geographically the shoreline within image pixels. The approach was applied to differently shaped shoreline extracts in imagery at two spatial resolutions. The most accurate prediction of the shoreline position from images with 16- and 32-m spatial resolutions were typically for a simple linear stretch of coast for which the smallest root mean square error values were <= 1.20 m. The shoreline predictions satisfied the map accuracy standards specified for large-scale maps.

Correlation analysis of water wave reflectance and local TSM concentrations in the breaking zone with remote sensing techniques	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												The coastal zone is a dynamic area in which processes with different origins and scales interact. Several techniques can be used for coastal zone monitoring. Remote sensing is a powerful tool for monitoring coastal processes and oastal areas. The quality of coastal water is a very important issue, and remote sensing optical sensors can be used to quantify water quality parameters such as suspended sediments. Therefore, it is possible to estimate the total suspended matter (TSM) concentration with multispectral satellite images. To extract meaningful information, the satellite data need to be validated with in situ measurements. The main objective of this work was to quantify TSM concentrations in the breaking zone with in situ measurements. In situ validation is important for the accuracy of correlations established. A section of the northwest coast of Portugal, near Aveiro city, was chosen as a test area, and all in situ measurements were done in this area. Several in situ techniques have been used to establish a relationship between seawater reflectance and TSM concentration for the range of wavelengths from 400 to 900 nm. Empirical relationships were established for equivalent reflectance values by SPOT/HRVIR (high-resolution visible Terra/ASTER (advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer), and Landsat TM (thematic mapper) at visible and near-infrared equivalent bands and TSM concentrations. The reflectance values were used to estimate TSM concentration with the use of the relationships established by in situ measurement. The reflectance of all bands of the satellite images tested showed high correlation with TSM in the wavelengths between 500 and 900 nm. The water leaving equivalent reflectance for each sensor equivalent band in the visible and near-infrared wavelengths was calculated, and a relationship between seawater reflectance and TSM concentration was established. The model coefficients and correlation factors for identical bands on different sensors presented good similarity. The work presented shows that TSM concentration in the breaking zone can be obtained directly from simulated multispectral satellite data. However, in situ measurements are essential to calibrate the process and establish the empirical relationships between TSM concentration and water leaving reflectance. The same empirical relationships found with in situ measurements will be used to estimate the TSM concentrations directly from real satellite data to try to quantify the sedimentary balance in the study area for the period of the satellite data.

Ice backscatter signatures at C band	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												For remote sensing of Great Lakes ice cover, afield experiment campaign was conducted in the 1997 winter season across the Straits of Mackinac and Lake Superior. The campaign was coordinated in two expeditions on two different United States Coast Guard icebreaker vessels, the Biscayne Bay in February and the Mackinaw in March. Aboard these icebreakers, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory C-band polarimetric scatterometer was used to measure backscatter signatures of various ice types and open water at incidence angles from 0 degrees to 60 degrees. The radar measurements include incidence angles and polalrizations of spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radars (SAR) on ERS, RADARSAT, and Envisat satellites. The radar data together with in situ measurements form a signature library that can be used to interpret SAR data for ice classification and mapping. Results are presented for backscatter signatures of Great Lakes ice types from thin lake ice to thick brash ice with different snow-cover and surface conditions. The signature library indicates that several ice types can be identified with multi-polarization SAR data; however, single-polarization data can result in misclassification of ice and open water at different ranges of incidence angle and wind conditions. For incidence angles larger than 30 degrees, thick brash ice, the most difficult for icebreaking operations and the most hazardous for ship navigation, can be uniquely identified by co-polarized backscatter for all wind conditions below the gale force.																	0380-1330					DEC	2007	33	4					722	735		10.3394/0380-1330(2007)33[722:SSRSOG]2.0.CO;2								WOS:000252473500002

Propagation and origin of warm anomalies in the Angola Benguela upwelling system in 2001	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												Warmer than average sea surface temperatures were observed by the Tropical Rainfall Mission Microwave Imager in the Angola Benguela Current system in late austral summer 2001 and persisted for about three months. These coastal anomalies extended offshore by 1 to 4 degrees longitude and were not due to local ocean atmosphere interaction or relaxation of the upwelling favorable southerly winds. Instead, they were remotely forced by ocean atmosphere interaction in the Tropical Atlantic. Satellite remote sensing and a linear ocean model suggest that relaxation of trade winds along the equator triggered Kelvin waves that crossed the basin within a month in early 2001. Westerly wind anomalies were also observed in December 2000 and January 2001 over most of the Tropical Atlantic contributing to a warm preconditioning due to an enhancement of the oceanic annual cycle. This led to abnormal sea level heights near equatorial Africa that propagated southwards along the coast towards the Angola Benguela Frontal zone. This process increased the seasonal penetration of warm and salty water of tropical origin into the Angola Benguela upwelling system. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

To test whether parks limit landscape fragmentation due to their designated protection or biophysical location, one must control for features that render the park inaccessible. We examine the effect of Celaque National Park, Honduras, on landscape fragmentation from 1987 to 2000 using remote sensing, GIS and landscape pattern analysis. Multivariate analyses of variance and covariance were conducted to examine differences in landscape fragmentation within the park and the surrounding landscape adjusting for differences in accessibility. Indicators of patch fragmentation were significantly correlated with slope, elevation and distance to roads. Different management categories within the park were found to have significant differences in land-cover change and landscape fragmentation, and the impact of management category was even more significant after accounting for the differences in accessibility that exist across these zones. Thus, the park boundaries have been important in mediating land-cover change pressures, even after accounting for the substantial differences in the accessibility of forestland for conversion to agricultural land use.

River plume patterns and dynamics within the Southern California Bight	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												Stormwater river plumes are important vectors of marine contaminants and pathogens in the Southern California Bight. Here we report the results of a multi-institution investigation of the river plumes across eight major river systems of southern California. We use in situ water samples from multi-day cruises in combination with MODIS satellite remote sensing, buoy meteorological observations, drifters, and HF radar current measurements to evaluate the dispersal patterns and dynamics of the freshwater plumes. River discharge was exceptionally episodic, and the majority of storm discharge occurred in a few hours. The combined plume observing techniques revealed that plumes commonly detach from the coast and turn to the left, which is the opposite direction of Coriolis influence. Although initial offshore velocity of the buoyant plumes was similar to 50 cm/s and was influenced by river discharge inertia (i.e., the direct momentum of the river flux) and buoyancy, subsequent advection of the plumes was largely observed in an alongshore direction and dominated by local winds. Due to the multiple day upwelling wind conditions that commonly follow discharge events, plumes were observed to flow from their respective river mouths to down-coast waters at rates of 20-40 km/d. Lastly, we note that suspended-sediment concentration and beam-attenuation were poorly correlated with plume salinity across and within the sampled plumes (mean r(2) = 0.12 and 0.25, respectively), while colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) fluorescence was well correlated (mean r(2) = 0.56), suggesting that CDOM may serve as a good tracer of the discharged freshwater in subsequent remote sensing and monitoring efforts of plumes.

An approach based on radiative transfer simulations was used providing systematic assessments. The study shows that when coloured dissolved organic matter ( CDOM) and non- algal particle ( NAP) concentrations are low, the seven algorithms tested, as expected, can retrieve chlorophyll with an error of, at best, 75% for 80 - 90% of the cases. The accuracy generally degrades rapidly with increasing CDOM and NAP concentrations. For the semianalytical algorithms ( bulk IOP retrieval enabled), the QAA algorithm achieved a better result at retrieving the total absorption, a, backscattering, bb and backscattering by particles, bb(p). However, none of the algorithms can break down the total absorption into components with reasonable accuracy. The study indicates that without incorporating regional and seasonal knowledge of specific IOPs the accuracy in water constituent retrievals from remote sensing is poor, hindering the use of remote sensing in water quality management.

The application of satellite data for the quantification of mangrove loss and coastal management in the Godavari estuary, East Coast of India	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The mangrove formations of Godavari estuary are due to silting over many centuries. The estuary covers an area of 62,000 ha of which dense Coringa mangrove forest spread in 6,600 ha. Satellite sensor data was used to detect change in the mangrove cover for a period of 12 years (1992-2004). It was found that an area of about 1,250 ha of mangroves was destroyed by anthropogenic interference like aquaculture, and tree felling etc. It was found that mangrove's spectral response/digital number (DN) value is much lower than non-mangrove vegetation such as plantation and paddy fields in SWIR band. By taking this as an advantage, spectral data was utilized for clear demarcation of mangroves from nearby paddy fields and other vegetation. Simpson's diversity index, which is a measure of biodiversity, was found to be 0.09, showing mangroves dominance. Ecological parameters like mud-flats/swamps, mangrove cover alterations, and biodiversity status are studied in detail for a period of 12 years. The increase in mangrove front towards coast was delineated using remote sensing data. The major advantages of remote sensing data is monitoring of change periodically. The combination of moderate and high-resolution data provided detailed coastal land use maps for implementing coastal regulation measures. The classification accuracy has been achieved is 90%. Overall, simple and viable measures are suggested based on multi-spectral data to sustain this sensitive coastal ecology.

ENVIRONNEMENT RISQUES & SANTE												The epidemiological cycles of West Nile virus (WNV) include birds as amplifying hosts, mosquitoes as vectors and humans and equines as sensitive dead-end hosts. Although WNV infection is often asymptomatic, it can lead to encephalitis in sensitive hosts. Its emergence in the Americas, where it causes thousands of clinical cases (mainly in the United States) has sparked the current interest in this virus. In France, WNV caused epizootics including several human cases in the beginning of the 1960s before it disappeared for 35 years. Since 2000, however, it has caused epizootics in the Camargue and sporadic human and/or equine cases in other parts of the Mediterranean coast. This paper reviews the studies conducted in recent years; our aim is to identify the vector species in southern France. Bird, human and horse-baited trap collections were conducted to identify the potential vectors. Mosquito exposure to virus under natural conditions was assessed by testing field-collected individuals for the presence of WNV Experimental infections allowed us to evaluate the susceptibility of potential vectors to infect with, amplify and transmit WNV These studies show that Culex modestus and Culex pipiens can be considered the principal WNV vectors in the Camargue wetlands, while Culex pipiens is probably the only vector in the dry coastal areas. After vector identification, a risk assessment for each species covering the appropriate time and space is necessary to propose prevention and control methods. Various approaches under development for these purposes, using modelling and remote sensing tools, are briefly described.																	1635-0421	1952-3998				NOV-DEC	2007	6	6					453	460										WOS:000253952300016

CURRENT SCIENCE												Conversion of coastal sand dunes to plantations has intensified dramatically after the tsunami of December 2004, driven largely by the belief that bio-shields mitigated tsunami inundation. This assumption was tested using field-based mapping and remote sensing. A regression between the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and inundation distance was non-significant, questioning the premise for large-scale bio-shield plantations, mostly Casuarina equisetifolia, an exotic timber with unquantified ecological impacts. These plantations may obliterate the natural sand dune ecosystems along the Coromandel coast, which are an important natural defence and provide a range of ecological goods and services.																	0011-3891					SEP 25	2007	93	6					831	833										WOS:000249933600026

In this paper, the extent of Bohai sea ice and its spatio-temporal changes are analyzed using AVHRR data at visible and infra-red wavelengths. A methodology is put forth to automate the differentiating of sea ice from sea water and land using NOAA-AVHRR band 3 spectral reflectances. It is shown that sea ice is concentrated on the east coast of the Bohai Sea, with the most promising reserves on the eastern coastal region of Liaodong Bay. In particular, the harvesting of Bohai sea ice reserves is estimated to yield a total freshwater volume of approximately 1.585 to 7.089 billion cubic meters (BCM). This corresponds to approximately 33.7 m3 to 150.8 m3 of freshwater per person in the Bohai Sea region.																	0250-8060					SEP	2007	32	3					483	493		10.1080/02508060708692226								WOS:000254806100015

Three target regions, namely the Yellow Sea (YS), Arabian Sea ( AS), and Saharan Coast (SC), are examined for quantitative comparisons of dust properties and their impacts on climate. Twenty year averaged Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) aerosol optical depth (AOD) data clearly show the peak dust season for the three target regions, March-April-May for YS and June-July-August for AS and SC. Georgia Institute of Technology-Goddard Global Ozone Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport (GOCART) modeled dust AOD fraction and Moderate Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS) large-mode AOD ratio are adopted to evaluate the dust fraction estimate. Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment ( SAGE) II aerosol extinction coefficient data are used to define the vertical distribution of dust. The elevated dust plumes are detected by subtracting the non-dust-season values from dust season values of SAGE II data, showing extinction peak around similar to 4 km over AS and SC. Over YS, dust plumes are found presenting multilayered structure. The shortwave ( SW) forcing of dust, although moderated by the longwave ( LW) effect, dominates the net effects ( SW + LW) of dust plumes. Under clear-sky ( i.e., cloudless) conditions, dust plumes reduce about 5.9 W m(-2), 17.8 W m(-2), and 14.2 W m(-2) regional and seasonal mean radiative flux reaching the surface over YS, AS, and SC, respectively. Of the three regions, dust plumes over AS have the largest effect on atmospheric heating owing to a lower single-scattering albedo and the relatively large dust loading. The maximum SW heating occurs over AS with the value around + 0.5 K/day inside the dust layer at similar to 4 km. The LW effect results in strong cooling throughout the dust layer and moderate heating below the dust layer, and dust plumes over SC exert the maximum LW effect on heating rates, with up to -0.5 K/day LW cooling in the free troposphere and about + 0.3 K/day warming in the boundary layer. As the sum of the SW and the LW heating rates, net heating rate shows a more complex pattern. Over SC, large LW cooling inside the dust layer offsets up to 80% SW heating and results in about -0.1 K/day net heating rate change at the height similar to 5 km over SC. Over AS the net heating rate change is dominated by SW heating because the maximum LW cooling is less than 60% of the SW heating, which leads to + 0.3 K/day net heating inside the dust layer and moderate heating below the dust base. The net heating rate change over YS is the smallest among the three regions, with magnitude within 0.1 K/day.																	2169-897X	2169-8996				AUG 31	2007	112	D16							D16208	10.1029/2007JD008427								WOS:000249335400002

Application of a chlorophyll index derived from satellite data to investigate the variability of phytoplankton in the Benguela ecosystem	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												The spatial and temporal variability in phytoplankton biomass in the Benguela ecosystem was investigated over an 8-year period using a chlorophyll index (Chi Index) derived from low resolution SeaWiFS ocean colour data. Monthly composite images revealed that the surface chlorophyll a concentration was high near the coast and generally decreased with distance offshore, allowing observation of the spatial extent of phytoplankton distribution in relation to coastal upwelling. The Chi Index was estimated as the integration of the chlorophyll a concentration from the coast to an offshore minimum level of 1mg m(-3). The index captured both the cross-shelf structure and the major part of the chlorophyllrich areas and was used to examine the average seasonality and annual variability in phytoplankton biomass. The data indicated that the Benguela ecosystem may be divided into two major sectors, north and south, with the divide occurring at the Luderitz upwelling cell where the Chi Index, the chlorophyll a concentration, and the offshore extent of phytoplankton were at a minimum. The index revealed a clearer and more contrasting seasonal pattern than simple coastal averaged values of chlorophyll. The latitudinal gradient and seasonal change in the index and wind forcing showed that the northern and southern sectors were out of phase and that the Benguela ecosystem appears to have a dipole structure. The interannual variation in biomass was highlighted and showed a high variability in the dipole, including shorter periods of synchronicity during 2001 and 2002. The simple Chi Index derived for the Benguela appears to be robust and generic enough to be applied to other upwelling systems as a reasonably good index of variability in phytoplankton biomass for comparative studies.

Cross-scale patterns in shrub thicket dynamics in the Virginia barrier complex	ECOSYSTEMS												To interpret broad-scale erosion and accretion patterns and the expansion and contraction of shrub thickets in response to sea level rise for a coastal barrier system, we examined the fine-scale processes of shrub recruitment and mortality within the context of the influence of ocean current and sediment transport processes on variations in island size and location. We focused on Myrica cerifera shrub thickets, the dominant woody community on most barrier islands along the coastline of the southeastern USA. Observations suggest that M. cerifera, a salt-intolerant species, is increasing in cover throughout the Virginia barrier islands, yet rising sea level in response to climate change is increasing erosion and reducing island area. Our objective was to explain this apparent paradox using pattern-process relationships across a range of scales with a focus on ocean currents and sediment transport interacting with island characteristics at intermediate scales. Multi-decadal comparisons across scales showed a complex pattern. At the scale of the entire Virginia barrier complex, modest decreases in upland area were accompanied by large increases in shrub area. Responses were more variable for individual islands, reflecting inter-island variations in erosion and accretion due to differences in sediment transport via ocean currents. Several islands underwent dramatic shrub expansion. Only for within-island responses were there similarities in the pattern of change, with a lag-phase after initial shrub colonization followed by development of linear, closed canopy thickets. Understanding the fine-scale processes of shrub seedling establishment and thicket development, in conjunction with the influence of ocean currents and sediment transport, provides a framework for interpreting island accretion and erosion patterns and subsequent effects on shrub thicket expansion or contraction across scales of time and space.																	1432-9840					AUG	2007	10	5					854	863		10.1007/s10021-007-9084-1								WOS:000249969200015

The research areas are located far away from groundwater influence and are therefore capable of indicating environmental changes. Climatic development in accordance with nearly 500 C-14 dates from archaeological sites indicates a Holocene optimum lasting from approximately 9500 B.P. till the beginning of the drying trend that set in about 6300 B.P. (9000-5300 cal. B.C.). Although the faunal and floral remains are and types, they indicate slightly wetter conditions than today. Surface water was the key factor that influenced the adaptation strategies of the mobile hunter-gatherers (and in some parts, the pastoralists) in the desert regions. Large episodic camp sites agglomerated at favorable drainage systems and water pools, and settlement patterns strongly correlate with the paleohydrological factors examined with remote sensing cartography, geomorphological work, and the analysis of digital elevation models.

Dynamics of the sea ice edge in Davis Strait	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												Sea ice concentration derived from satellite data were used to quantify, sea ice characteristics in the Baffin Bay-Davis Strait-Labrador Sea area. The ice edge in Davis Strait extends from Disko Bay in West Greenland 2500 km south to Newfoundland. The mean intercept at the West Greenland coast between 1979 and 2002 was located at 66.9 degrees N, assuming the ice edge was 85% ice concentration. The shallow banks of West Greenland (> 200 m) had, on average, an ice extent covering 3 0 to 100% of the bank area during March for the 24 year time series. This extent varied in concentration between 39 and 100%. However, intermediate ice concentrations (39-85% ice concentration) covered on average 25% of the banks. The Davis Strait ice edge showed considerable interannual variation correlated with the winter index of the North Atlantic Oscillation and the Arctic Oscillation. No temporal trend in ice extent could be detected over the 24 years. In addition to the ice production on the banks of West Greenland, sea ice produced further north in Baffin Bay was advected to the banks as shown by satellite tracked drifting buoys. Both the local sea ice production and the advected sea ice contributed significantly to sea temperatures and salinities measured during summer on the banks. No correlation between sea ice concentration and plankton abundance could be detected but the recruitment of the offshore cod (Gadus morhua) component in South Greenland was negatively correlated to the amount of sea ice in Baffin Bay.

J	Levin, N; Kidron, GJ; Ben-Dor, E				Levin, Noam; Kidron, Giora J.; Ben-Dor, Eyal			Surface properties of stabilizing coastal dunes: combining spectral and field analyses	SEDIMENTOLOGY												The coastal dunes of Israel have been undergoing a process of stabilization since 1948. One of the major features of this process is a change in the surface properties of the dunes - the development of a biological soil crust (BSC), and a change in the properties of the sand grains themselves. In Ashdod, at the southern coastal plain of Israel, sand properties that include the BSC, their fines (silt and clay) content and free iron-oxide (indicating their degree of rubification) have been analysed in detail using field and lab spectroscopy methods. In addition, sand erosion and deposition were measured using erosion pins to determine their effect on the presence of the above-mentioned factors. It was found that the BSC over these dunes is comprised of green algae that differs in its reflectance spectra from cyanobacterial crust, especially in the blue band. The crust was found to be particularly developed in the stable areas (mainly the interdunes) and on the north-facing slopes rather than on the south-facing slopes. A positive correlation was found between the crust fines and chlorophyll content, with stable areas showing more developed BSC. The stable areas showed also a lower albedo and slightly more developed reddish colour, indicating a slightly higher rate of rubification. This study demonstrates that the intensity of sand erosion/deposition rates affects soil properties, with the BSC being the fastest to react to the stabilization process (months to several years), followed by the content of fine particles (several years to a decade), whereas the rubification process is a much weaker marker and may need much longer time periods to develop (decades to centuries).

This study analyzed forest dynamics and spatial-temporal changes in land use/land cover pattern in a sub-temperate like alluvial forest land with 1778 km(2) area along the Eagan Sea coast of Turkey (Inegol). This area is studied by comparing Landsat images from 1987 to 2001 and evaluated with spatial analyses of forest cover type maps from 1972, 1983, 1993 to 2004 using GIS. The study investigated temporal changes of spatial structure of forest conditions over the period using Fragstats (TM). The results showed that the forested areas increased both in between 1972 and 1993 years (3.3%) and between 1987 and 2001 years (6.7%). In terms of spatial configuration, Inegol forests are generally fragmented in the latter periods due to intensive forest utilization, illegal use, expansion of settlements and infrastructural development in the lowlands. Land use pattern significantly changed over time depending on a few factors such as unregulated management actions, social pressure and demographic movements. In conclusion, land use changes have developed in favor of forestry over time between 1972-1993 and 1987-2001. The study revealed that demographic movements have a minor effect on landscape dynamics. Both spatial and temporal changes and the factors affecting these changes should be determined for developing sustainable management of forest resources. (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The acidic nature of the estuary soils (pH 5.8-6.2) along with redox potential -120mV favours high methane emissions. The samples collected from the edge of the estuary have shown 0.12-0.15% of Fe2+ wherein ambient methane concentrations were 4.8-5.6 ppmv. It was observed that the anoxic condition with high available iron in the soil improves anaerobic decomposition of organic matter to produce methane. The litter production from nearby mangrove vegetation in the estuary is approximately 22,000 tons/ annum is a causative factor for higher methane emissions. Remote sensing data was used and developed thematic maps for spatial and temporal distribution of methane using geographical information system. The seasonal trend showed high ambient concentration of methane in winter season, which is mainly due to high moisture content, (OH) radical and lower temperature. The results suggest that high organic matter (2.5-4.2%) along with soil conditions in the estuary are influencing for higher methane emissions, while in paddy fields the available organic matter for methanogenesis is limited.

Validation of SeaWiFS chlorophyll a in Massachusetts Bay	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												Massachusetts Bay, a semi-enclosed embayment (50 x 100 km) in the Northwest Atlantic, is the focus of a monitoring program designed to measure the effects of relocating the Boston Harbor sewage outfall to a site 15 km offshore in Massachusetts Bay. The Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA) in situ monitoring program samples selected stations up to 17 times per year to observe seasonal changes in phytoplankton biomass and other water quality variables. We investigated the feasibility of augmenting the monitoring data with satellite ocean color data to increase the spatial and temporal resolution of quantitative phytoplankton measurements. In coastal regions such as Massachusetts Bay, ocean color remote sensing can be complicated by in-water constituents whose concentrations vary independently of phytoplankton and by inaccurate modeling of absorbing aerosols that tend to be concentrated near the coast. An evaluation of in situ and sea-viewing wide field-of-view sensor (SeaWiFS) measurements from 1998 to 2005 demonstrated that SeaWiFS overestimated chlorophyll a mainly due to atmospheric correction errors that were amplified by absorption from elevated concentrations of chlorophyll a and colored dissolved organic matter. Negative water-leaving radiances in the 412 nm band, an obvious artifact of inadequate atmospheric correction, were recorded in approximately 60-80% of the cloud-free images along the coast, while the remaining portions of the Bay only experience negative radiances 35-55% of the time with a clear nearshore to offshore decrease in frequency. Seasonally, the greatest occurrences of negative 412 nm radiances were in November and December and the lowest were recorded during the summer months. Concentrations of suspended solids in Massachusetts Bay were low compared with other coastal regions and did not have a significant impact on SeaWiFS chlorophyll a measurements. A regional empirical algorithm was developed to correct the SeaWiFS data to agree with in situ observations. Monthly SeaWiFS composites illustrated the spatial extent of a bimodal seasonal pattern, including prominent spring and fall phytoplankton blooms; and the approximate 115 cloud-free scenes per year revealed interannual variations in the timing, magnitude and duration of phytoplankton blooms. Despite known artifacts of SeaWiFS in coastal regions, this study provided a viable chlorophyll a product in Massachusetts Bay that significantly increased the spatial and temporal synoptic coverage of phytoplankton biomass, which can be used to gain a comprehensive ecosystem-wide understanding of phytoplankton dynamics at event, seasonal and interannual timescales.

Quantitative remote sensing study indicates doubling of coastal erosion rate in past 50 yr along a segment of the Arctic coast of Alaska	GEOLOGY												A new quantitative coastal land gained-and-lost method uses image analysis of topographic maps and Landsat thematic mapper short-wave infrared data to document accelerated coastal land loss and thermokarst lake expansion and drainage. The data span 1955-2005 along the Beaufort Sea coast north of Teshekpuk Lake in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. Some areas have undergone as much as 0.9 kin of coastal erosion in the past 50 yr. Land loss attributed to coastal erosion more than doubled, from 0.48 km(2) yr(-1) during 1955-1985 to 1.08 km(2) yr(-1) during 1985-2005. Coastal erosion has breached thermokarst lakes, causing initial draining of the lakes followed by marine flooding. Although inland thermokarst lakes show some uniform expansion, lakes breached by coastal erosion display lake expansion several orders of magnitude greater than inland lakes.																	0091-7613					JUL	2007	35	7					583	586		10.1130/G23672A.1								WOS:000247895900002						
J	Weirich, F; Blesius, L				Weirich, Frank; Blesius, Leonhard			Comparison of satellite and air photo based landslide susceptibility maps	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Landslide susceptibility maps can be prepared in a variety of ways. Many geoscientists favour the use of an overlay model approach in which several map layers are combined by some arithmetic rules to determine the potential for sliding in an area or region. The resulting susceptibility maps, although based on a subjective weighting of relevant factors, can often be of high accuracy and utility. In order to obtain the relevant input data for this type of analysis, remotely sensed data are often used. To date, susceptibility mapping, just as the mapping of historic and individual landslides, has tended to require higher-resolution imagery. This has somewhat limited the application of landslide susceptibility mapping. While high-resolution air photo or satellite imagery is superior to lower resolution imagery for the purpose of mapping of historic and individual landslides, such higher levels of resolution may not be required for the development of landslide susceptibility maps. In order to determine if medium-resolution satellite imagery, such as SPOT or ASTER, could provide the needed data for landslide susceptibility mapping, a comparison was undertaken of landslide susceptibility model output resulting from the use of stereo NAPP aerial photography versus the use of data obtained from stereo SPOT imagery. The test area selected for this study consisted of two watersheds, Pena Canyon and Big Rock Canyon, situated west of Santa Monica, California, USA, along the Pacific Coast Highway. Both watersheds have a long and well-documented history of landslide activity and sufficient geologic variability and complexity to provide a good test site. The specific overlay model used in this evaluation required input data consistent with the needs of many other models of this type. The model output derived from the two different data sources and presented here in the form of susceptibility maps were virtually identical. Statistical and difference analysis confirmed that both methods of obtaining input data provide similar results and successfully identified landslide prone areas. These results suggest that satellite imagery, in this instance, SPOT images, could potentially be used in lieu of conventional air photos, to evaluate landslide susceptibility. In many situations, especially in the case of remote locations and/or developing countries, this capability should result in substantial savings in terms of time, financial resources, and overall viability.

Oceanic water intrusion into Kagoshima Bay resulting in thermal stratification	JOURNAL OF VISUALIZATION												Kagoshima Bay is an enclosed bay that has the tendency to undergo eutrophication, and a very important site to describe the behavior of open seawater intrusion. According to the results of the satellite SST (Sea Surface Temperature) image analysis or numerical simulation focused on the warm water intrusion into the bay in winter, a warm water mass originates in the meandering Kuroshio Current and reaches the mouth of the bay making the density flow to act like a semi-geostrophic current that is influenced by the Coriolis effect. However, there is still no information on the oceanic intruding flow during the summer, where it is accompanied by thermal stratification. In this research, satellite remote sensing and numerical simulation were employed to investigate the oceanic water intrusion into Kagoshima Bay during the summer season by using satellite chl-a (chlorophyll-a) images instead of SST. As a result, the distribution of the low-concentration chl-a with the oceanic water intrusion was found to be similar to the intrusion that occurs during the winter season. Furthermore, the numerical simulation was performed under the simple assumption that the thickness of the warm water mass that reaches the southern coast of Kyushu also shows the same tendency as in the winter season. Although the characteristics, such as the intruding speed or intruding pattern, are similar in winter, some features such as the generation of the inflow from the middle layer, showed a different tendency.																	1343-8875					JUL	2007	10	3					325	334		10.1007/BF03181700								WOS:000248292700018

In situ and remote-sensing measurements of the mean microphysical and optical properties of industrial pollution aerosol during ADRIEX	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY												We present a summary of the principal physical and optical properties of aerosol particles using the FAAM BAE-146 instrumented aircraft during ADRIEX between 27 August and 6 September 2004, augmented by sunphotometer, lidar and satellite retrievals. Observations of anthropogenic aerosol, principally from industrial sources, were concentrated over the northern Adriatic Sea and over the Po Valley close to the aerosol sources. An additional flight was also carried out over the Black Sea to compare east and west European pollution. Measurements show the single-scattering albedo of dry aerosol particles to vary considerably between 0.89 and 0.97 at a wavelength of 0.55 mu m, with a campaign mean within the polluted lower free troposphere of 0.92. Although aerosol concentrations varied significantly from day to day and during individual days, the shape of the aerosol size distribution was relatively consistent through the experiment, with no detectable change observed over land and over sea. There is evidence to suggest that the pollution aerosol within the marine boundary layer was younger than that in the elevated layer. Trends in the aerosol volume distribution show consistency with multiple-site AERONET radiometric observations. The aerosol optical depths derived from aircraft measurements show a consistent bias to lower values than both the AERONET and lidar ground-based radiometric observations, differences which can be explained by local variations in the aerosol column loading and by some aircraft instrumental artefacts. Retrievals of the aerosol optical depth and fine-mode (<0.5 mu m radius) fraction contribution to the optical depth using MODIS data from the Terra and Aqua satellites show a reasonable level of agreement with the AERONET and aircraft measurements.

Application of remote sensing video systems to coastline management problems	COASTAL ENGINEERING												This contribution evaluates the application of coastal video systems to monitoring and management of coastal stability problems on sandy coastlines. Specifically, video-derived parameters (coastal state indicators or CSIs) are developed which facilitate the measurement of the shoreline evolution (erosion/accretion) and response to storms, seasonal cycles and anthropogenic interventions like beach/shoreface nourishment and dredging. The primary variable which forms the basis for all the CSIs discussed in this contribution is the shoreline position derived from time-averaged video images. These waterlines are used to generate secondary products including shoreline contours at a constant pre-defined level, (intertidal) beach volumes, and momentary shoreline positions which reflect the sand volume in a meter wide section of the intertidal coast. Video-derived coastal state indicators were verified via comparisons with traditional topographical/bathymetric surveying techniques and a good agreement was found in all cases. CSIs were computed for three contrasting sandy coastal environments including an unprotected natural beach, a protected beach and a spit. Firstly, results are presented which demonstrate the advantages of coastal video systems over and above infrequent traditional topographic/bathymetric surveying methods. Namely, the ability of video-derived CSIs to quantify the magnitude, accurate location, precise timing and rates of change associated with individual extreme events and seasonal variability in the wave climate. Secondly, video-derived coastal state indicators were used to monitor two different types of human intervention, including beach nourishments and a dredged pit in a navigation channel. The video-derived datasets of coastal state indicators offered significant improvement to current CZM practices, facilitating better timing of management interventions as well as more effective monitoring of the spatial impact and longevity of these actions.

Qualitative assessment of tectonic lineaments over the coastal and innershelf of Kakinada and Kalingapatnam, Central East coast of India	JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA												Earth tremors of low to moderate intensity (3.0 to 5.5) recurring over last century in and around coastal and shelf regions of Visakhapatnam has prompted us to acquire and study the geophysical data between coastal regions of Kakinada and Kalingapatnam in western part of Central Bay of Bengal (17 degrees N - 18 degrees 30'N) for understanding the recent seismicity of the region. Preliminary analysis of magnetic and shallow seismic data reveals the presence of some prominent land-Ocean tectonic lineaments, reactivation of which is considered to be responsible for tremors in the region. Total field magnetic anomaly map of the study area shows two major anomaly lineations such as: (a) N-S trending medium amplitude (similar to 250 nT) lineation off Visakhapatnam which is considered to be offshore fragment of converging point of two onshore lineaments. Also the lineament is associated with five earth tremors of magnitude 3.7 to 4.3 at 40 m water depth. Impact of tremors is also observed in the overlying sedimentary strata in the form of vertical faults. (b) A NE-SW high amplitude anomaly zone (similar to 820 nT) off Kalingapatnam trending NE-SW, which is in close proximity with the epicentral location of earthtremors of 5.5 magnitude. This lineament can be spatially correlated to onshore NW-SE trending structural lineament indicating the probable reactivation of offshore segment resulting in the earth tremors. Off Vizianagaram, reactivation of preexisting structural lineaments associated with the NW-SE trending Kandivalasa river fault may be the source of tremors at 20 m water depth. Magnetic basement contour pattern changes from NE-SW to NW-SE off Visakhapatnam. It may be inferred that the basement is bounded by two fault controlled lineaments passing through epicenters of earthtremors off Visakhapatnam and Vizianagaram. Basement structure shows down faulted basement (2 to 3 km) underlying the epicentral location along the lineaments trending NW-SE in the innershelf of visakhapatnam. Shallow seismic data also indicate steeply dipping sub bottom fault in the study area of Visakhapatnam. South of Visakhapatnam, shallow seismic records indicate vertical faults and shearing reflectors in the lower sedimentary layers. From the deformed lower sedimentary layers. It may be considered that the region might have undergone seismic activity in the recent past, but presently there are no reported tremors in this region. Even undeformed top sedimentary layers suggest lack of recent tectonic activity between Visakhapatnam and Kakinada in coastal and shelf regions. It may be summarized from the preliminary analysis of the geophysical data that the earth tremors observed north of Visakhapatnam are caused mainly due to reactivation of tectonic lineaments whereas south of Visakhapatnam it is relatively free from any seismicity. Based on the felt reports, tremors are attributed to shallow focus origin. Detailed investigations from multidisciplinary approach like geological, geomorphological, geophysical and remote sensing observations coupled with seismic information in the study area will throw more light on the micro seismic activity and related recent tectonics of this coastal region of east coast of India.																	0016-7622					JUN	2007	69	6					1328	1334										WOS:000249556700024

Fog research: A review of past achievements and future perspectives	PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS												The scientific community that includes meteorologists, physical scientists, engineers, medical doctors, biologists, and environmentalists has shown interest in a better understanding of fog for years because of its effects on, directly or indirectly, the daily life of human beings. The total economic losses associated with the impact of the presence of fog on aviation, marine and land transportation can be comparable to those of tornadoes or, in some cases, winter storms and hurricanes. The number of articles including the word "fog'' in Journals of American Meteorological Society alone was found to be about 4700, indicating that there is substantial interest in this subject. In spite of this extensive body of work, our ability to accurately forecast/nowcast fog remains limited due to our incomplete understanding of the fog processes over various time and space scales. Fog processes involve droplet microphysics, aerosol chemistry, radiation, turbulence, large/small-scale dynamics, and surface conditions (e.g., partaining to the presence of ice, snow, liquid, plants, and various types of soil). This review paper summarizes past achievements related to the understanding of fog formation, development and decay, and in this respect, the analysis of observations and the development of forecasting models and remote sensing methods are discussed in detail. Finally, future perspectives for fog-related research are highlighted.

Mapping an invasive plant, Phragmites australis, in coastal wetlands using the EO-1 Hyperion hyperspectral sensor	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Mapping tools are needed to document the location and extent of Phragmites australis, a tall grass that invades coastal marshes throughout North America, displacing native plant species and degrading wetland habitat. Mapping Phragmites is particularly challenging in the freshwater Great Lakes coastal wetlands due to dynamic lake levels and vegetation diversity. We tested the applicability of Hyperion hyperspectral satellite imagery for mapping Phragmites in wetlands of the west coast of Green Bay in Wisconsin, U.S.A. A reference spectrum created using Hyperion data from several pure Phragmites stands within the image was used with a Spectral Correlation Mapper (SCM) algorithm to create a raster map with values ranging from 0 to 1, where 0 represented the greatest similarity between the reference spectrum and the image spectrum and I the least similarity. The final two-class thematic classification predicted monodominant Phragmites covering 3.4% of the study area. Most of this was concentrated in long linear features parallel to the Green Bay shoreline, particularly in areas that had been under water only six years earlier when lake levels were 66 cm higher. An error matrix using spring 2005 field validation points (n = 129) showed good overall accuracy - 81.4%. The small size and linear arrangement of Phragmites stands was less than optimal relative to the sensor resolution, and Hyperion's 30 in resolution captured few if any pure pixels. Contemporary Phragmites maps prepared with Hyperion imagery would provide wetland managers with a tool that they currently lack, which could aid attempts to stem the spread of this invasive species.

Satellite ocean color images and altimetry clearly revealed a series of cyclonic eddies, with diameters of about 100-150 km that were separated by about 150 km in the zonal direction. The eddies are found at almost the same locations and can be traced for at least two months in the spring-summer period. Cold and fresh anomalies were found throughout the water column in the cores of the cyclonic eddies. The water properties in the core of the eddies are similar to water found over the continental slope, 150-200 km to the south. The geopotential anomaly of the cold features was smaller than the sea level anomaly detected with satellite altimetry, indicating that significant barotropic flow is associated with the eddies. The Ocean general circulation model for the Earth Simulator ( OFES) reproduces a series of cyclonic eddies similar to those observed, including a significant barotropic component. In the model, the series of eddies appear to originate further west over the continental slope region with no consistent phase propagation. The combination of repeat in situ observations, remote sensing and high-resolution model results confirms the existence of persistent cyclonic eddies near 140 degrees E and suggests the eddies play an important role in the exchange of water across the Antarctic Divergence.

Spectral properties, iron oxide content and provenance of Namib dune sands	GEOMORPHOLOGY												This paper applies multispectral remote sensing techniques to map the Fe-oxide content over the entire Namib sand sea. Spectrometric analysis is applied to field samples to identify the reflectance properties of the dune sands which enable remotely sensed Fe-oxide mapping. The results indicate that the pattern of dune colour in the Namib sand sea arises from the mixing of at least two distinct sources of sand; a red component of high Fe-oxide content (present as a coating on the sand grains) which derives from the inland regions, particularly from major embayments into the Southern African escarpment; and a yellow coastal component of low Fe-oxide content which is brought into the area by northward-moving aeolian transport processes. These major provenances are separated by a mixing zone between 20 kin and 90 kin from the coast throughout the entire length of the sand sea. Previous workers have also recognised a third, fluvial, provenance, but the methodology applied here is not able to map this source as a distinct spectral component. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The performance of shoreline detection models applied to video imagery	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Digital images of the intertidal region were used to map shorelines and the intertidal bathymetry along four geomorphically and hydrodynamically distinct coastlines in the United States, United Kingdom, The Netherlands, and Australia: Mapping methods, each of which was originally designed to perform well at only one of the four sites, were applied to all four sites, and the results were compared to direct topographic surveys. It was determined that the rms errors of image-derived versus directly surveyed elevations depended on the prevailing hydrodynamic conditions as well as differences in each of the four different mapping methods. Before these differences were accounted for, rms errors ranged from 0.3 to 0.7 m. An empirical correction model that computed local estimates of setup, swash, and surf beat amplitudes reduced errors by about 50%, with residual rms errors ranging between 0.1 and 0.4 m. The model required tuning only one parameter that determined how each method was affected by swash at infragravity and incident wave frequencies. In environments where all methods successfully identify shorelines, the methods can be used somewhat interchangeably. The diversity of methods is advantageous in situations where one or more methods are likely to fail (e.g., lack of color imagery, high degree of alongshore variability). This remote sensing methodology can be applied to the shoreline and inter-tidal mapping problem across diverse nearshore environments.

Relationship between the evolution of the shoreline and the Posidonia oceanica meadow limit in a Sardinian coastal zone	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Important environmental changes have been observed for some coastal processes in the Gulf of Oristano (west coast of Sardinia, Italy). With remote sensing as the principal tool, this study aims to assess littoral evolution over time (1977-2000) and to evaluate whether there is a relationship between the evolutionary trend of the shoreline and that of the upper limit of the Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile meadow. Results show that some portions of the coastline, mainly located on the sandy part of the littoral, have encountered significant variations that can be partially related to the evolution of the upper limit of the P. oceanica meadow. Mainly of natural origins, this evolutionary trend has also been related to anthropogenic pressures put on the seagrass meadow. This finding confirms that Posidonia meadows significantly affect the littoral geomorphology, providing biogenic sediments, controlling beach slope, and acting as a '' brake '' on coastal water masses.

Tony			Estimating canopy structure of Douglas-fir forest stands from discrete-return LiDAR	TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION												Variations in vertical and horizontal forest structure are often difficult to quantify as field-based methods are labour intensive and passive optical remote sensing techniques are limited in their capacity to distinguish structural changes occurring below the top of the canopy. In this study the capacity of small footprint (0.19 cm), discrete return, densely spaced (0.7 hits/m(-2)), multiple return, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology, to measure foliage height and to estimate several stand and canopy structure attributes is investigated. The study focused on six Douglas-fir [Pseudotsuga menziesii spp. menziesii (Mirb.) Franco] and western hemlock [Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.] stands located on the east coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada, with each stand representing a different structural stage of stand development for forests within this biogeoclimatic zone. Tree height, crown dimensions, cover, and vertical foliage distributions were measured in 20 m x 20 m plots and correlated to the LiDAR data. Foliage profiles were then fitted, using the Weibull probability density function, to the field measured crown dimensions, vertical foliage density distributions and the LiDAR data at each plot. A modified canopy volume approach, based on methods developed for full waveform LiDAR observations, was developed and used to examine the vertical and horizontal variation in stand structure. Results indicate that measured stand attributes such as mean stand height, and basal area were significantly correlated with LiDAR estimates (r(2) = 0.85, P < 0.001, SE = 1.8 m and r(2) = 0.65, P < 0.05, SE = 14.8 m(2) ha(-1), respectively). Significant relationships were also found between the LiDAR data and the field estimated vertical foliage profiles indicating that models of vertical foliage distribution may be robust and transferable between both field and LiDAR datasets. This study demonstrates that small footprint, discrete return, LiDAR observations can provide quantitative information on stand and tree height, as well as information on foliage profiles, which can be successfully modelled, providing detailed descriptions of canopy structure.

NASA's MODIS-Terra and -Aqua can capture data at both 250 in and 500 in spatial resolutions and the existence of two sensors provides the possibility for multiple daily passes over a scene. However, no robust atmospheric correction method currently exists for these data, rendering them unusable for quantitative monitoring applications. Therefore, this paper presents an automatic and dynamic atmospheric correction approach allowing the determination of ocean colour. The algorithm is based around the standard MODIS 1 km atmospheric correction, includes cloud masking and is applicable to all of the visible 500 m bands. Comparison of the 500 m ocean colour data with the standard 1 km data shows good agreement and these results are further supported by in situ data comparisons. In addition, a novel method to produce 500 m chlorophyll-a estimates is presented. Comparisons of the 500 M estimates with the standard MODIS OC3M algorithm and to in situ data from a near-coast validation site are given. Crown Copyright (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Inc.

By early February a plume of volcanic ash was transported northward into the interior of Alaska. Satellite imagery and Puff volcanic ash transport model predictions confirm that the aerosol plume passed over a polarization lidar (0.694 mu m wavelength) site at the Arctic Facility for Atmospheric Remote Sensing at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. For the first time, lidar linear depolarization ratios of 0.10 - 0.15 were measured in a fresh tropospheric volcanic plume, demonstrating that the nonspherical glass and mineral particles typical of volcanic eruptions generate strong laser depolarization. Thus, polarization lidars can identify the volcanic ash plumes that pose a threat to jet air traffic from the ground, aircraft, or potentially from Earth orbit.																	0094-8276	1944-8007				APR 17	2007	34	8							L08803	10.1029/2006GL027237								WOS:000245950900001

Geological and geomorphological evolution of a sedimentary periglacial landscape in Northeast Siberia during the Late Quaternary	GEOMORPHOLOGY												A wide variety of environmental records is necessary for analysing and understanding the complex Late Quaternary dynamics of permafrost-dominated Arctic landscapes. A NE Siberian periglacial key region was studied in detail using sediment records, remote sensing data, and terrain modelling, all incorporated in a geographical information system (GIS). The study area consists of the Bykovsky Peninsula and the adjacent Khorogor Valley in the Kharaulakh Ridge situated a few kilometres southeast of the Lena Delta. In this study a comprehensive cryolithological database containing information from 176 sites was compiled. The information from these sites is based on the review of previously published borehole data, outcrop profiles, surface samples, and our own field data. These archives cover depositional records of three periods: from Pliocene to Early Pleistocene, the Late Pleistocene and the Holocene. The main sediment sequences on the Bykovsky Peninsula consist of up to 50 in thick ice-rich permafrost deposits (Ice Complex) that were accumulated during the Late Pleistocene. They were formed as a result of nival processes around extensive snowfields in the Kharaulakh Ridge, slope processes in these mountains (such as in the Khorogor Valley), and alluvial/proluvial sedimentation in a flat accumulation plain dominated by polygonal tundra in the mountain foreland (Bykovsky Peninsula). During the early to middle Holocene warming, a general landscape transformation occurred from an extensive Late Pleistocene accumulation plain to a strongly thermokarst-dominated relief dissected by numerous depressions. Thermokarst subsidence had an enormous influence on the periglacial hydrological patterns, the sediment deposition, and on the composition and distribution of habitats. Climate deterioration, lake drainage, and talik refreezing occurred during the middle to late Holocene. The investigated region was reached by the post-glacial sea level rise during the middle Holocene, triggering thermo-abrasion of ice-rich coasts and the marine inundation of thermokarst depressions.

It discusses the mechanical construction of the ASV, the distributed architecture of controller area network (CAN)-based nodes for science and vehicle payloads, highspeed radio-frequency (RF) communications, the performance of the heading autopilot, global positioning system (GPS)-based guidance algorithm, and the mission programming technique. The field trials of the ASV, performed off the coast of Goa, India, are focused on retrieving the 2-D spatial distribution of surface chlorophyll, which is one of the useful parameters in characterizing the nature of calibration-validation (CALVAL) sites for ocean remote sensing needs. A further benefit of ASVs is that they can be built at a low cost and used in monitoring applications of diverse coastal ecosystems.

The formation of colloidal sulphur in the upper water layer results from the oxidation of hydrogen sulphide. The occurrence of sulphur plumes as well as their temporal and spatial development was investigated in relation to the driving meteorological and oceanographic conditions. Because of the sporadic occurrence of sulphur events and the limited number of ship-borne investigations in that area remote sensing of ocean colour is the only method to follow these phenomena continuously and synoptically. In the past the sulphur plumes were studied by true colour images derived from ocean colour satellite data like sea-viewing wide field of view sensor or moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer and identified by their typical milky turquoise discoloration. For the first time, medium resolution imaging spectrometer (MERIS) reduced resolution Level-2 products were applied to identify sulphur discoloration in the surface water off Namibia. Based on their high spectral resolution typical spectral water-leaving reflectances were identified for sulphur enriched waters and distinguished from other optical water types dominated by absorbing or scattering phytoplankton groups and suspended matter. This was the basis for the development of a classification algorithm for the identification of sulphur plumes. This algorithm was derived on available MERIS scenes from the first half of the year 2004 and extended to summer 2005 to study the occurrence, the temporal and spatial development, the extension, and the strength of such events as well as inter-annual differences in these years. Only near-shore sulphur occurrences were identified in the considered time period compared to other studies. A lifetime of sulphur patches between I and 6 days and a zonal extent of up to 21 km were determined. The patches propagate in north-westerly direction with a current velocity of approximately 14 cm s(-1). The strongest events were detected in the Meob- and Saint Francis Bay in April 2004 and in April 2005. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Hydrodynamic characteristics of a fringing coral reef on the east coast of Ishigaki Island, southwest Japan	CORAL REEFS												To investigate the characteristics of currents on a fringing coral reef, a field survey was conducted, mostly under weak wind conditions in summer, on the east coast of Ishigaki Island, southwest Japan, which is encompassed by well-developed fringing reefs. For the same study period, numerical simulations of the current were also performed using a shallow water turbulent flow model with high accuracy reef bathymetry data, which were estimated from high-resolution imagery obtained from satellite remote sensing. The numerical simulation results showed good agreement with the observed data and revealed that the currents have an appreciable magnitude of tide-averaged velocities, even during neap tides, which are governed mostly by wave set-up effects. The results also indicated that temporal variations in velocity and water surface elevation during a tide cycle in the reef exhibit highly asymmetrical patterns; in spring tides especially, the velocities around channels indicate rapid transitions over a short period from peak ebb flow to peak flood flow. The simulations also indicated that a big channel penetrating deeply into the reef attracts the tide-averaged mean flow, even from distant areas of the reef.

Statistical, remote sensing-based approach for estimating the probability of catastrophic drainage from moraine-dammed lakes in Southwestern British Columbia	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												Safe development of glacierized regions requires a systematic and objective method for assessing the hazard posed by moraine-dammed lakes. Empirical relations exist for estimating outburst flood magnitude, but, until now, no standardized procedures have been developed for estimating outburst flood probability. To make quick and inexpensive preliminary assessments that are reproducible, we propose using a statistical, remote sensing-based approach to estimate the probability of catastrophic drainage of moraine-dammed lakes. We completed a comprehensive inventory of 175 moraine-dammed lakes in the southern Coast Mountains of British Columbia, Canada. By applying logistic regression analysis to the data set, we identified and weighted the following four independent predictor variables that best discriminate drained lakes from undrained lakes: moraine height-to-width ratio, presence/absence of an ice-core in the moraine, lake area, and main rock type forming the moraine. With an appropriate classification cutoff value, the predictive model correctly classifies 70% of drained lakes and 90% of undrained lakes, for an overall accuracy of 88%. Our model provides engineers and geoscientists with a tool for making first-order estimates of the probability of catastrophic drainage from moraine-dammed lakes in southwestern British Columbia.

Impact of satellite-derived forcings on numerical ocean model simulations and study of sea surface salinity variations in the Indian Ocean	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												This study focuses on two major aspects: the impact of satellite forcings (winds and precipitation) on the simulations of a multilayer Indian Ocean (IO) model (IOM) and the analysis of the processes responsible for salinity variations in the Indian Ocean during dipole years (1994 and 1997). It is observed that the European Remote Sensing Satellite-2 (ERS-2) scatterometer wind-driven solutions describe the interannual variabilities of sea surface temperature (SST) more realistically than the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) wind-driven solutions. The equatorial westward current jet [hereafter referred to as reverse Wyrtki jet (RWJ)] originating near the Sumatra coast in response to anomalous easterlies during fall of 1994 and 1997 is quite strong in the scatterometer-forced solutions. This RWJ is found to be weak in the NCEP solution. Two more experiments differing by their precipitation forcings [climatological and interannually varying Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) rainfall] are carried out. Model-simulated variables like SST, sea surface salinity (SSS), and mixed layer depth (MLD) have been compared with in situ observations to verify the performance of the model. The model suggests a dipolelike structure in surface salinity during late 1994 and 1997, with low salinity in the central equatorial Indian Ocean (EIO) and high salinity near the Sumatra coast. The low-salinity tongue is caused by the transport of fresh surface waters via RWJ, which is further strengthened by a southward branch (which is absent in normal years) coming from the Bay of Bengal. A major inference of the study is that the low-salinity tongue is caused mainly by advection, not by a direct effect of precipitation. On the contrary, the high salinity near the Sumatra coast is due to the strong upwelling caused by anomalous easterlies. Another inference made out of this study is that there is apparently a definite signature of the evolution of the dipole event in the MLD approximately 2 months prior to the peak occurring in SSS in the south EIO.																	0894-8755	1520-0442				MAR 1	2007	20	5					871	890		10.1175/JCLI4032.1								WOS:000244714000007

For the data interpretation, cloud images from the Japanese Geostationary Meteorological Satellite GMS-4 and the American Terra satellite, rain-rate maps from ground-based weather radars, sea surface wind data from the scatterometer on board the Quick Scatterometer (QuikSCAT) satellite, and meteorological data from weather maps and radiosonde ascents have also been used. It is shown that these atmospheric fronts are generated by the collisions of the two airflows from opposing directions: one is associated with a weak easterly synoptic-scale wind blowing against the high coastal mountain range at the east coast of Taiwan and the other with a local offshore wind. At the convergence zone where both airflows collide, air is forced to move upward, which often gives rise to the formation of coast-parallel cloud bands. There are two hypotheses about the origin of the offshore wind. The first one is that it is a thermally driven land breeze/katabatic wind, and the second one is that it is wind resulting from recirculated airflow from the synoptic-scale onshore wind. Air blocked by the mountain range at low Froude numbers is recirculated and flows at low levels back offshore. Arguments in favor of and against the two hypotheses are presented. It is argued that both the recirculation of airflow and land breeze/katabatic wind contribute to the formation of the offshore atmospheric front but that land breeze/katabatic wind is probably the main cause.

Michael			Modification of the atmospheric boundary layer by a small island: observations from Nauru	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												Nauru, a small island in the tropical Pacific, generates cloud plumes that may grow to over 100-km lengths. This study uses observations to examine the mesoscale disturbance of the marine atmospheric boundary layer by the island that produces these cloud plumes. Observations of the surface layer were made from two ships in the vicinity of Nauru and from instruments on the island. The structure of the atmospheric boundary layer over the island was investigated using aircraft flights. Cloud production over Nauru was examined using remote sensing instruments. The diurnal cycles of surface meteorology and radiation are characterized at a point near the west (downwind) coast of Nauru. The spatial variation of surface meteorology and radiation are also examined using surface and aircraft measurements. During the day, the island surface layer is warmer than the marine surface layer and wind speed is tower than over the ocean. Surface heating forces the growth of a thermal internal boundary layer, within which a plume of cumulus clouds forms. Cloud production begins early in the morning over the ocean near the island's lee shore; as heating intensifies during the day, cloud production moves upwind over Nauru. These clouds form a plume that may extend over 100 km downwind of Nauru. Aircraft observations showed that a plume of warm, dry air develops over the island that extends 15-20 km downwind before dissipating. Limited observations suggest that the cloud plume may be sustained farther downwind of Nauru by a pair of convective rolls. Suggestions for further investigation of the cloud plume are made.																	0027-0644					MAR	2007	135	3					891	905		10.1175/MWR3319.1								WOS:000245214600011

Precipitation measurement of Raudatain basin in Kuwait from TRMM data has been made and integrated with geological, geomorphological and hyrological data, to estimate the recharge potential of this basin. The total precipitation in the basin is estimated at 334 MCM for the year 2003. The initial losses are estimated at 78.43% and the transmission loss at 14.866% of the net precipitation. For sustainable management of the ground water resources, recharge wells have been proposed in the higher order streams to augment the Raudatain aquifer in Kuwait. If the available quantity of precipitation can be successfully utilized, it will reduce considerable pressure on desalination, which leads to increased salinity at the coast in Arabian Gulf.

The significant waves coming from north eastern direction cause considerable rate of sediment transport along 4 km sandy beach towards the fishery harbor in the region. The resulting sediment deposition near and inside the harbor entrance prevents the boat traffic and cause a vital problem for the harbor operations. In order to determine the level and reasons of the sediment transport, the long-term observations of shoreline changes, the long-term statistical analysis of wind and wave characteristics in the region, and sediment properties have been performed. The data obtained from observations, measurements and analysis were discussed. The long-term statistics of deep water significant wave heights for each direction was discussed by comparing the results obtained from different data sources and methods. For shoreline evolution, the numerical study using one-line model was applied to describe the shoreline changes with respect to probable wave conditions. Initial shoreline was obtained from the digitized image in 1996 since there was no previous shoreline measurement of the site. The results were compared using the techniques of remote sensing obtained from sequent images using IKONOS and IRSIC/D satellites. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

A supervised classification was carried out on the six reflective bands for the two images individually with the aid of ground truth data. Ground truth information collected during six field trips conducted between 1998 and 2002 and land cover map of 1987 were used to assess the accuracy of the classification results. Using ancillary data, visual interpretation and expert knowledge of the area through GIS further refined the classification results. Post-classification change detection technique was used to produce change image through cross-tabulation. Changes among different land cover classes were assessed. During the study period, a very severe land cover change has taken place as a result of agricultural and tourist development projects. These changes in land cover led to vegetation degradation and water logging in part of the study area. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

New mangrove ecosystem data along the UAE coast using remote sensing	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT					1st International Conference on the State of the Gulf Ecosystems	MAR 05-07, 2006	Al Ain, U ARAB EMIRATES					Characteristics of mangrove communities along the Gulf Coast of the UAE were explored using high-resolution satellite data Terra ASTER imageries in the common visible and near infra-red bands. Mangrove stands in three geographically distinctive sites, Khor Kalba, Khor Umm Al-Quwain and Al Dabbiya, were studied through spatial data and ground verification surveys. Mangroves in the UAE appear in patchy and scattered patterns, occupying about 40 km(2) of the coastal zone, half of which are located in Abu Dhabi in sheltered lagoons. The remaining areas are linear communities fringing tidal waterways distributed along intertidal zones. Their distribution is limited however, by aridity and site topography. Despite similarities in substrate conditions, differences in climatic and vegetation characteristics between the three sites indicate that growth conditions seem to be more favourable at Khor Kalba with the higher winter temperatures and higher annual rainfalls. Nine main units were recognized on the colour composite image of the Terra ASTER space data; dense vegetation, scattered vegetation, algal deposits, dry sand, sabkhas, settlements, recent deposits and turbid water, shallow water and deep water. Radiance did not allow for the separation of mangrove areas from inland vegetation through the supervised classification. Confusion was also encountered between different soil classes ( e. g. wet soils) and settlements or roads. It is concluded, therefore, that satellite data such as SPOT and Terra ASTER can be effectively analyzed through visual interpretations supported by local digital enhancement.																	1463-4988						2007	10	3					309	319		10.1080/14634980701512525								WOS:000249606800009

A meteorological overview of the MILAGRO field campaigns	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												We describe the large-scale meteorological conditions that affected atmospheric chemistry over Mexico during March 2006 when several field campaigns were conducted in the region. In-situ and remote-sensing instrumentation was deployed to obtain measurements of wind, temperature, and humidity profiles in the boundary layer and free atmosphere at four primary sampling sites in central Mexico. Several models were run operationally during the field campaign to provide forecasts of the local, regional, and synoptic meteorology as well as the predicted location of the Mexico City pollutant plume for aircraft flight planning purposes. Field campaign measurements and large-scale analyses are used to define three regimes that characterize the overall meteorological conditions: the first regime prior to 14 March, the second regime between 14 and 23 March, and the third regime after 23 March. Mostly sunny and dry conditions with periods of cirrus and marine stratus along the coast occurred during the first regime. The beginning of the second regime was characterized by a sharp increase in humidity over the central plateau and the development of late afternoon convection associated with the passage of a weak cold surge on 14 March. Over the next several days, the atmosphere over the central plateau became drier so that deep convection gradually diminished. The third regime began with the passage of a strong cold surge that lead to humidity, afternoon convection, and precipitation over the central plateau that was higher than during the second regime. The frequency and intensity of fires, as determined by satellite measurements, also diminished significantly after the third cold surge. The synoptic-scale flow patterns that govern the transport of pollutants in the region are described and compared to previous March periods to put the transport into a climatological context. The complex terrain surrounding Mexico City produces local and regional circulations that govern short-range transport; however, the mean synoptic conditions modulate the thermally-driven circulations and on several days the near-surface flow is coupled to the ambient winds aloft.

Reclamation environmental impact assessment (REIA) is also a complicated project, including the assessment of social economic background, ocean engineering, coastal geomorphology, sediment transportation, marine hydrodynamics and marine ecosystem and so on. Nowadays, a large number of land reclaimed projects have been carried out or in the process of construction along the coastal zone, thus, it is necessary to build up a framework on REM to evaluate and quantify the environmental changes, to contribute to reclamation program, to reduce marine environmental disasters, and to sustain development of coastal zone. This article focuses on the research of RELA framework theory and puts forward a REIA model on land reclaimed evaluation, at the same time, applies this assessment system in Shenzhen City, which is a highly developed coastal city with an expectation of land reclamation. By use of the Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques, along with the topographic map and in situ survey in reclamation area, it concludes that the area of 2680 hectares in total has been reclaimed in Shenzhen city by the end of the year 2000. Thus, reclamation is usually applied to meet the needs for infrastructure, such as harbors, industries and highways in Shenzhen City. However, some serious negative impacts have been created to the coastal environment shown clearly in the following aspects. Firstly, it caused the dramatic changes of tidal flat and channels along the western coast, made this area more unstable, which is threatening the function of the harbor in this area. Secondly, Tidal prism has decreased rapidly. During the 20 years of reclamation, the tidal prism has been reduced by 20% similar to 30% along the western coast in the Lngdingyang Estuary, and 15.6% in the Shenzhen Bay. As a result, the velocity of the tidal current has also declined, and the direction of the tidal current has changed, which is harmful to the dilution and diffusion process of the contaminants. Thirdly, it has threatened the eco-environment finally., More than 147 hectares of mangrove area along the coast of Shenzhen Bay, accounting for 48.8% of the total mangrove reserve area in this region, has been reclaimed only during the short period from 1988 to 2000. Thus, the biodiversity is decreasing, and more and more plants and animals are disappearing. Based on the above analyses of the environmental impacts, strategies and suggestions for the future reclamation in this area have been put forward in order to support the sustainable development of the coastal zone.																	0890-5487						2007	21	2					343	354										WOS:000247856500014						
J	Moore, TS; Matear, RJ; Marra, J; Clementson, L				Moore, Thomas S., II; Matear, Richard J.; Marra, John; Clementson, Lesley			Phytoplankton variability off the Western Australian Coast: Mesoscale eddies and their role in cross-shelf exchange	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												We utilize over 6 years of remotely sensed chlorophyll a estimates from sea-viewing wide-field-of-view sensor (SeaWiFS), along with in situ observations from the targeted sampling of mesoscale eddies during the 2000 "Transport Indian Pacific" (TIP2000) cruise to characterize phytoplankton variability on and off the central Western Australian (WA) shelf. Much of the variability is associated with mesoscale eddies, and we find that, contrary to canonical ideas, satellite and in situ estimates of surface chlorophyll off WA show low phytoplankton biomass in cyclonic eddies and high biomass in anticyclonic eddies. Off-shelf we found two types of phytoplankton communities; modified shelf communities in anticyclonic eddies and offshore subtropical communities concentrated in the deep chlorophyll maximum outside the anticyclonic eddies. The presence of the modified shelf community offshore in anticyclonic eddies supports a shelf-based origin and cross-shelf distribution mechanism for phytoplankton off the central WA coast. Anticyclonic eddies, formed adjacent to the shelf, entrain shelf waters with relatively high chlorophyll a concentrations and, as they propagate westward, export coastal phytoplankton communities offshore. The formation of anticyclonic eddies appears to occur at preferred locations along the WA coast. Our observations suggest that the anticyclonic eddy communities are long-lived (5 months or more) and their maintenance may result from the sub-mesoscale injection of nutrients into the eddy boundary.

J	Thu, PM; Populus, J				Thu, Phan Minh; Populus, Jacques			Status and changes of mangrove forest in Mekong Delta: Case study in Tra Vinh, Vietnam	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Because shrimp culture in the Mekong Delta develops rapidly, it has negatively impacted the environment, socio-economics and natural resources. In particular, mangrove forests have been altered by the shrimp culture. The area of mangrove forests in the region has been reduced and this is seen especially in Tra Vinh province. The results obtained from GIS (Geography Information System) and RS (Remote Sensing) show the status of mangrove forests in Tra Vinh province in 1965, 1995 (Northeastern part of Tra Vinh Province) and 2001. In 1965, the area of mangrove forests was 21,221 ha making up 56% of total land-use, while in 2001 it was 12,797 ha making up 37% of total land-use. Also based on GIS analysis, over the 36 years (1965-2001), the total coverage of mangrove forests have decreased by 50% since 1965. However, the speed of mangrove forest destruction in the period from 1965 to 1995 was much less than that in the period from 1995 to 2001. The average annual reduction in mangrove forest coverage in the first period (1965-1995) was 0.2% whereas it was 13.1% in the later period (1995-2001). For the long time, mangrove deforestation has been caused by war, collection of firewood and clearing for agriculture, and recently, shrimp farming has significantly contributed rate of mangrove destruction.

J	Sonmez, NK; Sari, M				Sonmez, Namik Kemal; Sari, Musiafa			Monitoring land use change in the West Mediterranean region of Turkey: A case study on Antalya-Turkey coast	FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN												Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS), technologies offer suitable tools for long-term monitoring and assessment of land-use change. Turkey's Western Mediterranean region is an area of national and international economic importance from natural, agricultural, historical and tourism perspectives. Recognizing these facts, this study aims to identify and highlight temporal land-use changes in the Belek Special Protected Area indicating common land-use tendencies of the Western Mediterranean region. Land-use changes and transformations in the last 23 years were determined using RS and GIS technologies with high-resolution satellite images and aerial photographs. The study area is approximately 13.000 ha, and 13 different land-use classes were identified as well as changes in each class analyzed between 1981-2004. Results indicate that forest areas decreased from 627.1 ha in 1981, to 624.9 ha in 1992, and 219.3 ha in 2004. Similarly, stable coastal dune areas decreased from 387.9 ha in 1981, over 324.9 ha in 1992, to 195.1 ha in 2004. In contrast, tourism and secondary residence area land-use increased rapidly from 13.0 ha in 198 1, to 231.0 ha in 1992, and 1052.5 ha in 2004. In general, a reduction of natural and agricultural land classes by human activity was observed in the last 23 years, and most of this land appears to be converted to tourism and secondary residence use. Specifically, between 1981 and 2004, land-use changed the Belek Special Protected Area exhibiting a 65 % reduction in forest areas, 50 % reduction in stable coastal dune areas, and an 800 % increase in tourism and secondary residence areas. According to these findings, almost all converted areas were degraded by human activity without consideration of sustainable land-use principles, causing serious environmental problems for the natural resources of the region, which cannot be recovered. Although this region is protected by law, negative tendencies cannot be prevented by the existing law. Therefore, legally based land-use planning that takes into account the region's socio-economic conditions, is necessary to protect this region.

J	Guo, QH; Kelly, M; Gong, P; Liu, DS				Guo, Qinghua; Kelly, Maggi; Gong, Peng; Liu, Desheng			An object-based classification approach in mapping tree mortality using high spatial resolution imagery	GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING												In California, a newly discovered virulent pathogen (Phytophthora ramorum) has killed thousands of trees, including tanoak (Lithocarpus densiflorus), coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia), and black oak (Quercus kelloggii). Mapping the distribution of overstory mortality associated with the pathogen is an important part of disease management. In this study, we developed an object-based approach, including an image segmentation process and a knowledge-based classifier, to detect individual tree mortality in imagery of I m spatial resolution. The combined segmentation and classification methods provided an easy and intuitive way to incorporate human knowledge into the classification process. The object-based approach significantly outperformed a pixel-based maximum likelihood classification method in mapping the tree mortality on high-spatial-resolution multispectral imagery.

Spatio-temporal analysis of multi-date IRS imageries for turtle habitat dynamics characterization at Gahirmatha coast, India	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												This paper reports the conceptualization of a remote sensing based technique to map the spatio-temporal change pattern of the coastal landforms of Gahirmatha, India, the world's biggest olive ridley sea turtle rookery. Twenty-seven Indian Remote-sensing Satellite (IRS) multispectral satellite images sampled between the period 1988-2001 are the basic input for the study. While the mapping of temporal change position of the landform centroids revealed the migrational behaviour of the landforms, the tide normalized change detection indicated the habitat surface area dynamics. The analysis revealed that the Ekakula spit of Gahirmatha estuary has undergone cyclone-induced mass erosion during its 14 years' evolutionary history, thereby destroying its nesting habitat. However, the Nasi barrier bar had shifted its position by about 6.85 km without significant change in geo-environment including surface area and hence continued to be the favourable site for turtles' mass nesting. The results have aided in understanding the impact of natural processes on the nesting habitat dynamics.																	0143-1161						2007	28	5					871	883		10.1080/01431160701269838								WOS:000245076500003

Using remote sensing to assess the protective role of coastal woody vegetation against tsunami waves	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												This paper describes how remote sensing techniques were used to study the effect of mangroves and other woody coastal vegetation as a protective measure against the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami. Remote sensing made it possible to compare pre- and post-Tsunami images of large areas. A study site was selected based on medium resolution Landsat imagery and existing topographic maps. Selection criteria included substantial damages reported, presence of woody vegetated and non-vegetated shorelines, homogeneous bathymetry and good coverage of pre- and post-Tsunami satellite imagery. The Pichawaram mangrove, Tamil Nadu, India, matched these criteria. Pre- and post-Tsunami Ikonos and QuickBird images were compared through the visual interpretation of pre-Tsunami coastal vegetation and post-Tsunami damage. The results were validated in the field. The analysis showed that mangrove forests and coastal shelterbelts provided protection from the Tsunami. This was concluded from analysing the spatial distribution of damage relative to woody vegetation along the coast as well as transects detailing the amount of damage behind the coastline and the coastal woody vegetation.																	0143-1161						2007	28	13-14					3153	3169		10.1080/01431160701420597								WOS:000247469000020						
J	Wu, W				Wu, W.			Coastline evolution monitoring and estimation - a case study in the region of Nouakchott, Mauritania	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Since the construction of a harbour, Port de l'Amitie, an important importation gate for Nouakchott, northwestern Africa in 1987, the previous coast dynamic equilibrium has been destroyed and thus a significant littoral geomorphologic change has occurred, which has produced a severe degradation of the littoral and urban environment. This research is focused on coastline evolution monitoring and its potential change estimation by remote sensing techniques using multitemporal Satellite pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) images and Markov chain analysis. It is the objectives of the study to measure and estimate the coastal current hydrodynamics, coastline evolution rates, harbour life-span and to provide useful reference for the local authorities to make decisions for their future coastal management. The results show that the north beach of the harbour has extended by 0.92km(2) (92 ha) from 1989 to 2001 and the accretion will probably reach its maximum limit in about 13 years +/- 6 months (in 2014-2015) while the harbour will gradually arrive at the end of service. The south sandbar has been eroded by 1.34km(2) (134 ha) and the coastline has retreated landwards by 362m at the maximum point. Another 0.91km(2) of land will be eroded in the next 10 years from 2001 to 2011. This erosion has caused several inundations to the suburb and urban areas, provoking a deterioration of the urban environment.																	0143-1161						2007	28	24					5461	5484		10.1080/01431160701227612								WOS:000251751600003

Application of remote sensing and GIS for the demarcation of groundwater potential zones of a river basin in Kerala, southwest coast of India	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												An integrated hydrogeological investigation has been made to delineate the groundwater-potential zones of the Muvattupuzha river basin, Kerala, along the southwest coast of India. The basin is characterized by charnockites and gneisses of Archean age covering more than 80% of the area and the remaining by Pleistocene laterites and Miocene formation. The basin receives high rainfall, measuring 3100 mm/year. However, acute water shortage occurs during the premonsoon season and hence, a number of dug wells are made to tap the groundwater. Seasonal rainfall during NE and SW monsoons is the major source of groundwater recharge. Further, hydrogeomorphology, geology, fracture systems and the slope of the terrain also play a significant role on the movement and behaviour of the groundwater of this basin. The integration of conventional and remote sensing data has been made through geographic information system (GIS) and it is found that about 50% of the area can be identified as very good or good potential zones, whereas the remaining area falls under moderate and poor categories. Most of the Muvattupuzha sub-basin and the western part of the Kothamangalam and Kaliyar sub-basins are classified as good groundwater-potential zones, although the eastern upstream part of the basin has poor groundwater potential.

The island is highly vulnerable to damage from pollution associated with coastal activities, massive tourism development and hotel constructions along the coast of Al Ghardaqa. High resolution QuikBird satellite images were used for mapping the mangrove vegetation on the island and to establish a baseline database for future monitoring of the changes of the mangrove habitat on the island.

Mapping of land cover changes at Conde municipality coastal zone, State of Bahia, Brazil, using medium resolution satellite data. Journal of Coastal Research, SI 50 (Proceedings of the 9th International Coastal Symposium), 33 - 37. Gold Coast, Australia, ISSN 0749.0208 The easier access to medium resolution natural resources satellite data has greatly popularised the use of this type of information in land cover studies and ecosystems management. This paper presents the results of a study of land cover changes in a coastal area located in eastern Brazil (Conde Municipality - State of Bahia). Using a Geographic Information System (GIS), Landsat multi-temporal data (1984, 1995 and 2003) were photo interpreted and converted to raster maps. Overlay operations (map algebra) were then used to assess and quantify land cover changes within the studied area. It was found that the documented changes were mostly related to an increase in tourism and summer resident population, directly related to the construction of the BA-099 highway, also known as Green Line (Linha Verde). In some places, ecosystem degradation arising from these recent occupation patterns could be mapped. Overall however, the ecosystems preservation status between 1984 and 2003 can be considered very good. The methodology used can be easily applied for other sites and proved to be an easy and cheap alternative for environmental institutions interested to quickly evaluate ecosystems preservation status and land use trends during the last few decades. Coastal management initiatives can be better planned and implemented using this kind of spatially geo-referenced data.

A monitoring network for assessing the impact of extreme marine meteorological events on tropical beaches. Journal of Coastal Research, SI 50 (Proceedings of the 9th International Coastal Symposium), 77 - 81. Gold Coast, Australia, ISSN 0749.0208 Since 2003, a monitoring network of the dynamics of sandy beaches has been in operation in three tropical sites: Martinique (French West Indies), Tahiti and Moorea (French Polynesia) and Mayotte (Mozambique Channel). The objective of this network is to measure the impact of extreme weather-related marine events (storms, cyclones, strong swells, surges ...) on beaches with varied structural settings and sedimentary environments. The methodology consists in the installation of observatories on the dynamics of sandy beaches in different morphological and sedimentary contexts. A "state zero" is established from a combination of satellite imagery, low altitude digital imagery and topographic and hydrodynamic measurements. These measurements are reiterated after an extreme event in order to apprehend the importance of morphological change, impact dampening and recovery. The monitoring is then continued over regular intervals with the aim of determining rates of morphological and sediment budget recovery until equilibrium is restored. This experimental network design will subsequently be extended to other tropical beaches located on the propagation paths of cyclones.																	0749-0208						2007					50		77	81										WOS:000207860300016

Operative Monitoring of the Extent of Dredging Plumes in Coastal Ecosystems Using MODIS Satellite Imagery	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												MODIS band 1 imagery is the only satellite data with acceptable spatial resolution (250 m) and sufficient revisit times (up to 4 times a day) potentially available for monitoring dredging plumes. The aim of this study was to determine the potential use of MODIS band 1 imagery in an optically sophisticated environment such as the Baltic Sea coastal waters for monitoring of total suspended matter in natural conditions and near dredging activities. It was found that there is linear correlation between MODIS band 1 (620-670 nm) reflectance and the total suspended matter concentration measured from water samples. The regression algorithm was used to produce suspended matter concentration maps and monitor dredging activities. The results showed that in such shallow water environments as the Estonian Coast resuspension caused by strong wind may increase the suspended matter concentration to the levels similar to those occurring during dredging. Areas affected by wind resuspension are much larger than the areas affected by dredging plumes. Therefore, the natural variability of suspended matter concentration has to be taken into account when estimating environmental impact of dredging activities on local ecosystems.

Journal of Coastal Research, SI 50 (Proceedings of the 9th International Coastal Symposium), 427 - 431. Gold Coast, Australia, ISSN 0749.0208 Wave data are needed in coastal areas to help increase safety of ship navigation and improve coastal protection strategies. In recent years, remote sensing of surface waves and currents became a powerful tool, especially in areas with high spatial and temporal variability. The data discussed in this paper was measured with the wave monitoring system WaMoS II. This system is based on a standard marine X-band radar and can be operated from platforms, coastal buildings and from moving vessels. In contrast to wave buoys, this kind of data covers a rather large area with high temporal and spatial resolution. This paper presents data obtained from the island of Sylt, Germany and from the entrance to Port Phillip Bay, Melbourne, Australia. Both regions are characterised by a complex bottom topography that leads to a highly spatially variable wave field. For the Sylt data, examples of wave transformation such as refraction, shoaling and dissipation are described and quantified. The Melbourne data is described qualitatively showing the abilities of area covering wave measurements over such a complex topography.																	0749-0208						2007					50		427	431										WOS:000207860300082

Dynamics of the Karwar Coast, India, with special reference to study of Tectonics and Coastal Evolution using Remote Sensing Data	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Multi-temporal satellite data has been used for change detection (coastal erosion/accretion), identifying beach ridges and tectonic influence at Karwar coast, Central West Coast of India. The change detection study shows that the coast has experienced net erosion during the 13 years of observation. It has experienced a net erosion of 661.86 and 924 hectares during 1989-2000 and 2000-2003 respectively. This observation indicates that the erosion of land was dominant during 2000-2003. It can be noted that the amount of erosion during 2000-2003 (3 years) is 1 1/2 times more than the net erosion during 1989-2000 (11 years). This could be mainly due to human interference in the form of expansion of settlements, development of industries, mining activity, establishment of Konkan railway, construction of naval base, influence of dams built across Kali River and much other interference apart from the changing weather and coastal processes that happened during the period. It is observed that the beach ridges are slowly vanishing along the coast especially at Karwar and Majali, owing to urbanisation and other developmental activities. The beach ridges at Majali are formed owing to the presence of Kangiguda Island and to some extent by Kurmagad Island, which is supporting the formation of spit at the southern end of Majali beach (northern portion of Kali River mouth) owing to tombolo effect. The entire city of Karwar has been built on numerous beach ridges. Many lineaments traversing and criss-crossing the area have been mapped which have variable extent and different azimuthal orientation as obtained by visual interpretation. The lineaments have been identified along the river course, creeks, hill ridges and they are linear and continuous. It is evident from the study of lineaments that the coast is structurally controlled. The present paper is the outcome of a study of satellite data of this coast with the available literature as supporting or ground truth input.																	0749-0208						2007					50		842	847										WOS:000207860300157

By classifying three kinds of remote sensing imagery, we compared abilities to detect invasive mangrove distributions and to discriminate mangroves from surrounding terrestrial vegetation. Using three analytical techniques, we compared mangrove mapping accuracy for various sensor-technique combinations. ANOVA of accuracy assessments demonstrated significant differences among techniques, but no significant differences among the three sensors. We summarize advantages and disadvantages of each sensor and technique for mapping mangrove distributions in tropical coastal environments.

The main objective of this study is the quantification of the TSM concentration around the sea breaking zone for a particular area of the Portuguese coast, near Aveiro city. The methodology used was based on in situ measurements and on multispectral satellite image from TERRA/ASTER. In situ experimental techniques were used to determine a relationship between the TSM concentration and the seawater reflectance. Empirical relationships were established between TSM concentration and the equivalent reflectance values for TERRA/ASTER at visible and near infrared bands computed from the experimental data. The reflectance values had a very high correlation with the TSM concentration in the wavelength between 500 and 900 nm. The ASTER image was calibrated, atmospherically and geometric corrected. Equations of linear, polynomial, logarithmic, power and exponential models were applied. The best results were found with the linear and polynomial models, with a determination factor higher than 0.95. However, the differences in the TSM concentration calculated for the three bands indicate that we should not use the information of a single band to obtain the TSM concentration.

Ecotone system of the southeastern coast of the Tsimlyansk Reservoir	WATER RESOURCES												The results of multidisciplinary environmental field studies aimed to elucidate the forms of influence of the Tsimlyansk Reservoir onto coastal ecosystems are presented. The ecotone analysis of the ecosystem structure of the reservoir coast is proposed as an approach to the analysis of the collected data. A brief characteristic of a version of a geographic information system based on field and remote-sensing data is given. A relationship is shown to exist between the reservoir level regime according to 10-year data and the transformation of vegetation cover on the coast against the background of minor changes in soils for the 50-year period of reservoir existence.

After performing georeferencing and normalization of the images, density slicing was used to extract the waterline. Comparisons of extracted waterline positions with ground-level data for eight transects and global positioning system (GPS) tracks of the island shorelines showed that NIR bands were superior to SWIR bands because of the characteristics of the coral reef coasts, including a lack of foam and suspended sediments (which can affect the NIR wavelength region, if present) and the presence of remnant water on reef flats during low tide (which can affect the SWIR wavelength region). A linear relationship was found between the estimation errors of waterline positions and the spatial resolutions of the NIR sensors. Analysis on estimation errors and image costs showed that Terra ASTER band 3 was the most cost-effective sensor for extracting waterlines with reasonable accuracy. The results serve as general guidelines for using satellite-derived data to estimate intertidal topography and detect and monitor shorelines in coral reef environments. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

J	Bourras, D				Bourras, Denis			Comparison of five satellite-derived latent heat flux products to moored buoy data	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												Five satellite products of latent heat flux at the sea surface were compared to bulk fluxes calculated with data from 75 moored buoys, on almost 36 successive months from 1998 to 2000. The five products compared are the Hamburg Ocean Atmosphere Parameters and Fluxes from Satellite Dataset (HOAPS-2), the Japanese Ocean Flux Datasets with Use of Remote Sensing Observations (J-OFURO), the Jones dataset, the Goddard Satellite-Based Surface Turbulent Fluxes, version 2 (GSSTF-2), and the Bourras-Eymard-Liu dataset (BEL). The comparisons were performed under tropical and midlatitude environmental conditions, with three datasets based on 66 Tropical Atmosphere-Ocean array (TAO) buoys in the tropical Pacific, nine National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) buoys off the U. S. coasts, and four Met Office/ Meteo-France (UK-MF) moorings west of the United Kingdom and France, respectively. The satellite products did not all compare well to surface data. However, for each in situ dataset (TAO, NDBC, or UK-MF) at least one satellite product was found that had a good fit to surface data, that is, an rms deviation of 15-30 W m(-2). It was found that HOAPS-2, J-OFURO, GSSTF-2, and BEL satellite products had moderate systematic errors with respect to surface data, from-13 to 26 W m(-2), and small biases at midlatitudes (6-8 W m(-2)). Most of the satellite products were able to render the seasonal cycle of the latent heat flux calculated with surface data. The estimation of near-surface specific humidity was found to be problematic in most products, but it was best estimated in the HOAPS-2 product. GSSTF-2 and J-OFURO strongly overestimated the surface flux variations in time and space compared to surface data and to a flux climatology. With respect to TAO data, Jones fluxes yielded good results in terms of rms deviation (27 W m(-2)) but also presented a large systematic deviation. Overall, for application of the satellite fluxes to the world oceans, it was found that HOAPS-2 was the most appropriate product, whereas for application to the Tropics, BEL fluxes had the best performance in rms with respect to TAO data (24 W m(-2)).																	0894-8755					DEC 15	2006	19	24					6291	6313		10.1175/JCLI3977.1								WOS:000243005500003

We used a data set of approximately 13,500 specimen records compiled from both historical and contemporary collections resulting from recent intensive inventory efforts to enumerate total plant species richness and to analyze the degree of endemism within littoral forests. Change in littoral forest cover from original to current extent was estimated using geographical information systems tools, remote sensing data (satellite imagery and low-elevation digital photography), and environmental data layers. Of the original littoral forest only 10.3% remains in the form of small forest parcels, and only 1.5% of these remaining fragments are included within the existing protected-areas network. Additionally, approximately 13% of Madagascar's total native flora has been recorded from these forests that originally occupied < 1% of its total land surface, and over 25% of the 1535 plant species knownfrom littoral forests are endemic to this community Given the ongoing pressure from human settlement along Madagascar's eastern coast, protection of the remaining forest fragments is critical for their survival. Fifteen of the largest intact littoral forest fragments we identified, collectively representing 41.5% of remaining littoral forest, are among priority sites recommended to the government of Madagascar for plant conservation and incorporation into the protected-areas network.																	0888-8892					DEC	2006	20	6					1799	1803		10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00562.x								WOS:000242724500030	17181815

Discerning resuspended chlorophyll concentrations from ocean color satellite imagery	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												Ocean color satellite imagery has been used to detect blooms of phytoplankton for decades. A bloom in this sense is defined as a rapid increase in chlorophyll-a concentration from newly synthesized sources (primary production) within the photic zone. Chlorophyll also has the potential to enter the water column from benthic sources as a result of resuspension events. Currently available bio-optical ocean color algorithms estimate the near-surface chlorophyll concentration in the water column but cannot characterize the source. By estimating resuspension, one can isolate the proportion of the total chlorophyll present in the water column that originated from benthic sources. The increase in remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) at 670nm as measured by SeaWiFS appears as a result of an increase in suspended materials, therefore, providing an estimate of resuspension. After examining imagery in locations of variable resuspension along the Texas coast, a strong positive correlation between the Rrs(670) produced by resuspension and the ratio of resuspended chlorophyll to total water column chlorophyll was observed.

Coastal landslide material loss rates associated with severe climatic events	GEOLOGY												Deep-seated landslides along the California coast deliver large amounts of material to the nearshore littoral environment. Landslide movement, a combined result of slope base undercutting by waves and ground saturation, is highly episodic. Movement occurs primarily during periods of high rainfall and large waves, such as those associated with El Nino events. This analysis applies remote-sensing techniques to quantify the volumetric net loss rates at three specific landslide sites along the Big Sur coast over three approximately decadal time periods, two of which contained the largest El Nino events of the twentieth century. High-resolution historical terrain models were compared in order to provide surface-elevation change data for each landslide complex. To determine the material influx to the littoral system, the landslide complexes were divided into upper and lower slopes, and the surface-elevation change was converted to a volume loss. Some material lost from the upper slope was deposited at the slope base, not into the littoral system. We describe a method to calculate the net loss that omits the deposition volumes from the upper slope. Loss rates were found to be substantially higher during the periods in which El Nino events occurred. This is especially true during the period of the 1997-1998 El Nino, when 75% of the total material volume was lost, and loss rates were as much as sixteen times higher than during non-El Nino periods.																	0091-7613					DEC	2006	34	12					1077	1080		10.1130/G22900A.1								WOS:000242630000022

Improved monitoring of HABs using autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV)	HARMFUL ALGAE												Blooms of toxic algae are increasing in magnitude and frequency around the globe, causing extensive economic and environmental impacts. On the west coast of Florida, blooms of the toxic dinoflagellate Karenia brevis (Davis) have been documented annually for the last 30 years causing respiratory irritation in humans, fish kills, and toxin bioaccumulation in shellfish beds. As a result, methods need to be established to monitor and predict bloom formation and transport to mitigate their harmful effects on the surrounding ecosystems and local communities. In the past, monitoring and mitigation efforts have relied on visual confirmation of water discoloration, fish kills, and laborious cell counts, but recently satellite remote sensing has been used to track harmful algal blooms (HABs) along the Florida coast. Unfortunately satellite ocean color is limited by cloud cover, lack of detection below one optical depth, and revisit frequency, all of which can lead to extended periods without data. To address these shortcomings, an optical phytoplankton discriminator (OPD) was developed to detect K. brevis cells in mixed phytoplankton assemblages. The OPD was integrated into autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) platforms to gather spatially and temporally relevant data that can be used in collaboration with satellite imagery to provide a 3D picture of bloom dynamics over time. In January 2005, a Remote Environmental Monitoring UnitS (REMUS) AUV with an OPD payload was deployed on the west coast of Florida to retrieve a similarity index (SI), which indicates when K. brevis dominates the phytoplankton community. SI was used to monitor a K. brevis bloom in relation to temperature, salinity, chlorophyll, and ocean currents. Current speed, SI, temperature, salinity, and chlorophyll a from the AUV were used to quantify a 1 km displacement of the K. brevis bloom front that was observed over the deployment period. The ability to monitor short term bloom movement will improve monitoring and predictive efforts that are used to provide warnings for local tourism and fishing industries. In addition, understanding the fine scale environmental conditions associated with bloom formation will increase our ability to predict the location and timing of K. brevis bloom formation. This study demonstrates the use of one autonomous platform and provides evidence that a nested array of AUVs and moorings equipped with new sensors, combined with remote sensing, can provide an early warning and monitoring system to reduce the impact of HABs.

Coastal erosion on the Rio Grande do Norte state (Northeastern Brazil): Causes and factors versus effects and associated processes	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Coastal erosion is present in many parts of the Rio Grande do Norte coast, with origin attributed mostly to the small fluvial contribution of sediments and lost of sediments to the land, with the field dunes formation. The methodology used in this study used multitemporal products of remote sensing and air photographs, current beach profiles and hydrodynamic measurements, as well as geological and geophysical survey on land and on the shelf. The integration of these data set allows a better comprehension of the causes and origins of coastal erosion. The most important factors and causes observed on this study are related to i) coastal circulation dynamics, ii) Holocene evolution of the coastal plain, iii) naturally inefficient sediment supply, iv) construction of hard interface structures, and v) tectonic factors. The results showed erosion areas are linked to large scale bottom morphology on the setentrional sector, and to large scale coast morphology on the oriental sector. The changes are mainly due to longshore drift contributions and negative sediment budget.																	0749-0208					WIN	2006					39		1306	1309										WOS:000202961500014

Monitoring of coastal dynamics in French Guiana from 16 years of SPOT satellite images	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												The Guianas coast, northwest of the mouth of the Amazon river, experiences a very strong supply of muddy sediment that entails major coastal modifications at seasonal to annual timescales. Mud supply is predominantly in the form of mud banks migrating alongshore from the Amazon to the Orinoco. In this paper, focus is placed on the geomorphic change that has affected the 60 km stretch of coastline between Cayenne and Kourou (French Guiana) from 1986 to 2002. The remote sensing analysis demonstrates an overall erosion of 60 km(2) of sea-front mangrove swamps. Anew mud bank migrating towards Kourou since 1991 has led to a significant reduction in erosion and has even enabled the commencement of mangrove colonization. Aspatio-temporal matrix applied to both the vegetated and inter-tidal parts of the mud bank highlights the interplay between mud bank migration and mangrove colonization.				gratiot, nicolas/G-8071-2016													0749-0208					WIN	2006					39		1502	1505										WOS:000202961500054

Multitemporal analysis of geoenvironmental elements of the coastal dynamics of the region of the Ponta do Tubarao, City of Macau/RN, on the basis of remote sensing products and integration in GIS	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												The study area is inserted on the region of Macau in the northern coast of the Rio Grande do Norte State, composed of tertiary and quaternary sediments. This region is characterized by the intense action of coastal processes, causing the morphologic instability in the area beyond the interference of human activities, petroliferous industry, salt companies and the expansion of shrimp farms. This situation justifies the integration of scientific multidisciplinary and multitemporal studies to the evaluation of the changing behavior of this coastal environment. This study of environmental characterization is a basic tool to the identification of areas for protection and recovery, mainly those that suffer huge social-economic intervention. The main goal of this paper is the geoenvironmental monitoring by the analysis of multitemporal images (from years 1989, 2000 and 2001) of georeferencing orbital sensors, from the topographic maps (SUDENE SB-24-X-D-II Macau and SB-24-X-D-III Sao Bento do Norte, both with 1: 100.000 scale) and photos from low altitude aerial surveys. These sensors products had been analyzed by through digital image processing techniques to produce index maps (land use, geology, geomorphology and soil) and environmental vulnerability to the social-economic occupation, aiming to determine sensitive and/or damaged areas. The thematic maps had been produced on 1: 50.000 scale and stored in georeferencing database composed in a GIS, being used as source of consultations in a decision making to the environmental sustainable of the region and on Oil-Spill Environmental Sensitivity Maps of the CoastAreas. The application of these techniques in the area allowed the optimization and/or implantation of social-economic activities causing low environmental impact, avoiding environmental protected areas and benefiting the investors with better productivity and security in areas selection.

Morphodynamics of the tidal inlets of Ennore Creek and Pulicat Lake, north Chennai coast, southeast India	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												The Ennore Creek and the Pulicat Lake are located north of Chennai city and provide subsistence for a large part of fishing community. The frequent closure of their mouths (inlets) cause problems in fishery. This study has been carried out to identify the morphological changes taken place at the inlets of Ennore Creek (Latitude 13 degrees 14'10" N and Longitude 80 degrees 19'00" E) and Pulicat Lake (Latitude 13 degrees 27'40" N and Longitude 80 degrees 19'00" E). Survey of India Toposheet for the year 1974 in 1:50,000 scale was used as a base map and IRS IA and IRS I D satellite imagery for 1990 and 1998 were compared with the base map for Pulicat Lake inlet. Shoreline survey has been carried out periodically along the coast adjoining the inlets to find out the morphological changes. Remote sensing satellite imagery of IRS I D PAN data of 5.6m resolution for 27(th) March 1999 was used as a base. Data collected as UTM coordinates using real time KGPS during shoreline survey during 2000 and 2001 have been plotted on the image and joined as a shoreline using ArcView GIS 3.2 software. From the study it was observed that enormous accretion has taken place in the inlets, which led to the closure of mouth in recent years. In the Pulicat Lake inlet about 170 m of accretion has taken place during 2000-2001, which has led to the closure of mouth during 2001. In this study for coastline simulation, a numerical model, LITLINE module in LITPACK model has been adopted. Model was run by introducing two jetties on either side of the inlets of Ennore Creek and Pulicat Lake in order to have the ideal solution for eliminating the problem of frequent closing of inlets. It has provided fruitful solution of permanent opening of the inlets. Therefore it is concluded that immediate mitigation measures such as construction of parallel jetties on both the sides of the inlet and/or continuous dredging are to be carried out. It is suggested that a long-term monitoring is essential to have the better understanding and future planning.																	0749-0208					WIN	2006					39		1906	1909										WOS:000202961500142						
J	Menesguen, A; Gohin, F				Menesguen, Alain; Gohin, Francis			Observation and modelling of natural retention structures in the English Channel	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												Accumulation of heat, or dissolved substances (nutrients, pollutants, etc.), or fine suspended particles in a water body is a key process in the functioning of aquatic ecosystems and their resistance to perturbations. In complex and wide open environments such as marine ecosystems, net accumulation is not only linked to the local renewal capacity of the water body, but also to the partial recirculation of water due to convective cells of various sizes. The English Channel, which can be considered as mainly dominated by tidal movements, exhibits such a complex quasi-permanent long-term circulation, made of a central "river" bordered with a lot of nested gyres. Here, we show that structures visible on satellite images of SST (Sea Surface Temperature), chlorophyll and SPIM (Suspended Particulate Inorganic Matter) can be explained by steady state distributions of tracers having various half-life durations, which can be computed using a simple technique of regularly distributed micro-injection in the permanent flow field. Gyres induced by capes in open water appear to be retention areas, whereas gyres around islands (Channel Isles) appear to be strong disseminating areas, acting as slings. Moreover, SST satellite maps can be explained by a short-lived tracer during the "transitory" seasons (spring and autumn), and by a long-lived one during the "stable" seasons (summer and winter): long-term accumulation structures become apparent only in August and March. SPIM can be considered as a tracer injected only in muddy areas by the bottom friction caused by the swell, and having a half-life duration linked to the turbulent energy dissipation, which controls the settling rate; this succeeds to explain the observed turbidity in the central Channel essentially, as well as the striking asymmetry visible on images between the large turbid coastal band along the English coasts (materializing a natural long-term retention area), and the rather clear waters along the French coasts. The annual mean chlorophyll distribution in the Channel, as derived from satellite reflectance, can be simulated by a short-lived tracer injected proportionally to the mean light availability along the water column. Computing steady state distributions of various substances or particles in permanent circulation gives a simple and quick tool for understanding their mean stable distribution patterns in the oceans.

A remote-sensing technique for the identification of aeolian fetch distance	SEDIMENTOLOGY												This paper describes a new method for assessing aeolian fetch distances in beach/dune systems. The remote-sensing technique has advantages over currently used proxy measures of fetch distance, such as those based on tide gauges and beach profiles. The method uses a digital camera, global positioning system surveying, and a geographical information system software package to produce a rectified image of the beach surface. From this, direct measurements of the wet-dry beach boundary can be combined with wind direction measurements to determine fetch distance. The method offers an improvement on current approaches to sediment transport estimates: a 28-day study on Magilligan Strand, Northern Ireland, showed that the commonly used high water mark approach overestimated fetch distance by 30% compared with the technique reported here.

Influence of aerosol particles from biomass burning on cloud microphysical properties and radiative forcing	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH					14th International Conference on Clouds and Precipitation	JUL 19-23, 2004	Inst Atmospher Sci & Climate, Bologna, ITALY	Int Assoc Meterol & Atkmospher Sci, Int Commiss Clouds & Precipitat, Int Union Geodesy & Geophy	Inst Atmospher Sci & Climate			Aerosol from biomass burning has been shown to strongly modify cloud microphysical properties and cloud lifetime through the so-called "indirect effect." However, in the case of a lack of wet scavenging, it stays suspended for days to weeks and can be transported to considerable distances within an elevated layer above low-level cloud tops with minimal aerosol-cloud interactions. The observations carried out during the Southern African Regional Science Initiative (SAFARI) 2000 dry season field campaign often revealed the presence of an elevated biomass-burning aerosol layer above a semi-permanent stratiform cloud deck off the southern African coasts. MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) cloud products were used to investigate the existence of an aerosol indirect effect on convective clouds. Results are presented documenting cloud effective radius and cloud radiative forcing variations due to the presence of the aerosol during the development of convective clouds. Radiative transfer simulations in the visible (0.8 mu m, VIS) and near-infrared (1.6, 2.1 and 3.7 mu m, NIR) wavelengths were instrumental in establishing the extent of the influence of a biomass-burning aerosol layer overlying a water cloud sheet on the MODIS satellite retrieval of cloud parameters, in particular the effective radius and the optical thickness. The radiative transfer simulations suggest that the presence of the aerosol induces a significant underestimation of the cloud optical thickness, whereas an underestimation of the retrieved effective radius is more pronounced in the retrieval that makes use of the 1.6 mu m waveband than the 2.1 and 3.7 gm wavebands. The MODIS cloud products of 3 days of the SAFARI 2000 campaign were analyzed to determine whether the aerosol induced biases evidenced by the simulations also affect the operational cloud property retrieval. Cloud parameters, in particular the effective radius, are usually employed as indicators of the occurrence of aerosol-cloud interaction according to the "indirect effect." However, these results highlight some of the difficulties associated with satellite retrievals of cloud properties and show the importance of an accurate sighting of the cloud and aerosol layer top and bottom heights in order to prevent erroneous detections of indirect effects.

J	Mason, DC; Scott, TR; Wang, HJ				Mason, David C.; Scott, Tania R.; Wang, Hai-Jing			Extraction of tidal channel networks from airborne scanning laser altimetry	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING												Tidal channel networks are important features of the inter-tidal zone, and play a key role in tidal propagation and in the evolution of salt marshes and tidal flats. The study of their morphology is currently an active area of research, and a number of theories related to networks have been developed which require validation using dense and extensive observations of network forms and cross-sections. The conventional method of measuring networks is cumbersome and subjective, involving manual digitisation of aerial photographs in conjunction with field measurement of channel depths and widths for selected parts of the network. This paper describes a semi-automatic technique developed to extract networks from high-resolution LiDAR data of the inter-tidal zone. A multi-level knowledge-based approach has been implemented, whereby low-level algorithms first extract channel fragments based mainly on image properties then a high-level processing stage improves the network using domain knowledge. The approach adopted at low level uses multi-scale edge detection to detect channel edges, then associates adjacent anti-parallel edges together to form channels. The higher level processing includes a channel repair mechanism. The algorithm may be extended to extract networks from aerial photographs as well as LiDAR data. Its performance is illustrated using LiDAR data of two study sites, the River Ems, Germany and the Venice Lagoon. For the River Ems data, the error of omission for the automatic channel extractor is 26%, partly because numerous small channels are lost because they fall below the edge threshold, though these are less than 10 cm deep and unlikely to be hydraulically significant. The error of commission is lower, at 11%. For the Venice Lagoon data, the error of omission is 14%, but the error of commission is 42%, due partly to the difficulty of interpreting channels in these natural scenes. As a benchmark, previous work has shown that this type of algorithm specifically designed for extracting tidal networks from LiDAR data is able to achieve substantially improved results compared with those obtained using standard algorithms for drainage network extraction from Digital Terrain Models.

Land cover change within the Grand Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve: 1974-2001	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Estuarine water bodies provide a land to sea (freshwater to saltwater) transition zone. Protected from the full force of waves, winds, and storms by topographic features, e.g., reefs and barrier islands, estuaries provide habitats for countless numbers of plant and animal species. An estuary's wetlands, including salt marshes, naturally improve,all water quality by acting as filters. Thus, there are societal benefits to preserving estuaries. The U.S. government, in fact, passed the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972, creating the National Estuarine Research Reserve (NERR) System. The present study documents temporal land cover change occurring during the period 1974-2001 within the Grand Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve (GBNERR)-the 24th NERR, designated in 1999. Occupying an area of 7284 hectares, it is one of the largest relatively undisturbed estuarine marsh-pine savanna habitats remaining on the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico. Results were obtained by applying both unsupervised classification and change detection techniques to data derived from Landsat satellite imagery acquired in 1974, 1991, and 2001, respectively. Land cover classes included open water, herbaceous wetland, forest, and barren land. For change detection analysis, change matrices were derived from postclassified pairs of successive image dates, yielding two change matrices. A map of overall cover change between 1974 and 2001 was also produced. Submersion of wetlands by water, attributed to a combination of factors, including rising sea levels, land subsidence, and historical geomorphologic changes that increased wave action and decreased sedimentation, caused a majority of the observed changes. Such a broad land cover analysis provides resource managers with information regarding the estuary's land cover types and spatial distributions, allowing for more informed decisions with regard to preserving biodiversity and planning restoration efforts.																	0749-0208					NOV	2006	22	6					1552	+		10.2112/05-0582.1								WOS:000242695100023						
J	Ramasamy, SM				Ramasamy, S. M.			Remote sensing and active tectonics of South India	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The Indian Peninsula in general and its southern part in particular has been thought to be a stable shield area and hence inert to younger earth movements and seismicities. However, in addition to fast relapsing seismicities, the studies carried out by earlier workers during the past three decades indicate possible pulsatory tectonism, at least since the Jurassics. The present study is a newer attempt to identify, analyse, and spatially amalgamate a large number of anomalies visibly displayed by the tectonic, fluvial, coastal, and hydrological systems in remote sensing and ground based datasets/observations, and to finally paint a fair picture on the active tectonic scenario of South India. The study reveals that the phenomena, viz. extensive soil erosion, reservoir siltation, sediment dump into the ocean, preferential migration of rivers, restricted marine regression, shrinkage of back waters, withdrawal of creeks, fall of groundwater table, etc., indicate two E-W trending ongoing tectonic (Cymatogenic) archings along Mangalore-Chennai in the north and Cochin-Ramanathapuram in the south. Intervening these two arches, a cymatogenic deep along Ponnani-Palghat-Manamelkudi exhibiting phenomena opposite to the above is observed. In addition, the characteristic tectonic, geomorphic, and hydrological anomalies observed in 1B satellite FCC data, as well as in the field, indicate N-S trending extensional, NE-SW sinistral, and NW - SE dextral strike slip faults. These anomalies and the tectonic features deduced thereupon, indicate that the southern part of the Indian Peninsula is tectonically active due to the northerly to north-northeasterly directed compressive force related to post collision tectonics. This active tectonic model visualized for South India gives a further clue that the whole Indian plate is whirling like a worm with alternate E-W arching and deepening, along with block and transform faulting from Cape Comorin in the south to the Himalayas in																	0143-1161					OCT 20	2006	27	20					4397	4431		10.1080/01431160500502603								WOS:000241651200002

Surface melting observations in Antarctica by microwave radiometers: Correcting 26-year time series from changes in acquisition hours	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Surface melting duration and extent of the Antarctic coasts and ice-shelves is a climatic indicator related to the summer temperature and radiative budget. Surface melting is easily detectable by remote sensing using passive microwave observations. The preliminary goal of this study is to extend to 26 years an existing data set of surface melting [Torinesi, O., Fily, M., Genthon, C. (2003), Interannual variability and trend of the Antarctic summer melting period from 20 years of spaceborne microwave data, J. Climate, 16(7), pp. 1047-1060] by including the most recent years of observation. These data come from 4 microwave sensors (the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) and three Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I)) observing the surface at different hours of the day. Since surface melting varies throughout the day as the air temperature or the radiation, the interannual melting extent and duration time series are biased by sensor changes. Using all the sensors simultaneously available since 2002, we were able to model the diurnal variations of melting and use this hourly model to correct the long-term time series. This results in an unbiased 26-year long time series better suited for climate analysis. The cooling trend found by Torinesi et al. using uncorrected time series for the 1980-1999 period is confirmed but the decreasing rate is weaker after correction. Furthermore, extending the series up to summer 2004-2005 reveals recent changes: the last 2 summers have been particularly warmer over all the East Antarctica compared to the 10 previous years, thus ending the cold period of the 1990s. The trend over 1980-2005 is no longer toward cooling but complex climatic variations appear. The time series are available at http://www.lgge.obs.ujf-grenoble.fr/-picard/melting/.

The Hillarys Transect (1): Seasonal and cross-shelf variability of physical and chemical water properties off Perth, Western Australia, 1996-98	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												A 27-month study of the water properties across the continental shelf off Perth, Western Australia (the "Hillarys Transect"), has provided the first systematic interdisciplinary climatology of the physical, chemical, optical and biological cycles across the shelf. This paper describes the main features of the seasonal and cross-shelf variability of the physical oceanography and chemistry, while companion papers discuss some of the links between the biology and physics of the region. The oceanography is dominated by the seasonally varying Lecuwin Current flowing southwards along the shelf break and outer shelf, and the northwards inshore Capes Current which is driven by the net southerly wind stress between about October and March (the austral summer). As a result of the poleward boundary current, there is no large-scale upwelling comparable with the Humboldt and Benguela Current systems. Water temperature and salinity in the shallow coastal waters are largely influenced by air sea heat flux processes, while advection plays a more important role along the outer shelf, as a consequence, seasonal variations in the inshore temperature and salinity are much larger than those offshore. Cross-shelf exchange of water and plankton is effected by (1) large-scale meandering of the Leeuwin Current, (2) horizontal mixing as tongues of Leeuwin Current water penetrate across the shelf, (3) cascading of high-density coastal water offshore along the seabed and (4) sporadic summer upwelling onto the outer shelf (including the wake effect north of Rottnest Island). Nutrient and chlorophyll concentrations are low in comparison with other typical west coast situations. While there is some indication of a seasonal cycle, the relatively short sampling period and high patchiness have precluded definitive patterns being described and longer-term sampling may be required to resolve this. The effects of smaller-scale temperature and chlorophyll variability on satellite remote sensing measurements (both "within pixel" and "between pixel") in these coastal waters have been quantified using the underway (horizontal) and profile (vertical) data from the surveys. The project has demonstrated the great potential of using remote sensing information for regular monitoring of the Western Australian continental shelf waters provided that adequate in situ validation measurements are also undertaken.

J	Sackmann, B; Perry, MJ				Sackmann, Brandon; Perry, Mary Jane			Ocean color observations of a surface water transport event: Implications for Pseudo-nitzschia on the Washington coast	HARMFUL ALGAE												A persistent patch of high biomass water, associated with the Juan de Fuca Eddy, is often observed in surface chlorophyll a images off the southwest coast of Vancouver Island, Canada. Outbreaks of toxic Pseudo-nitzschia spp. along the Washington, USA, coast are believed to correlate with the transport of waters from Juan de Fuca Eddy southward to Washington beaches. A time series of Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) satellite ocean color images from late May 1999 of coastal waters off Washington and Vancouver Island, processed for surface chlorophyll a concentration and spectral remote sensing reflectance, captured a transport event where water from the Juan de Fuca Eddy was transported onto the Washington shelf. Strong upwelling-favorable winds appeared to deform the patch over an 8-day period and move it southward into Washington coastal waters with surface velocities of approximately 8-16 km d(-1). SeaWiFS and sea surface temperature imagery showed the local phytoplankton response to wind-driven coastal upwelling restricted to a narrow (10-15 km) region along the Washington coast. Although we did not observe transport of high biomass water originating in the Juan de Fuca Eddy to Washington beaches in May 1999, transport of Pseudo-nitzschia cells could occur following a rapid shift to downwelling-favorable conditions. Tracking the trajectory of surface waters from the Juan de Fuca Eddy by remote sensing could be used to trigger conditional sampling for domoic acid along the Washington coast. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Characterizing observed environmental variability with HF Doppler radar surface current mappers and acoustic Doppler current profilers: Environmental variability in the coastal ocean	IEEE JOURNAL OF OCEANIC ENGINEERING					4th Radiowave Oceanography Workshop	2004	N Queensland, AUSTRALIA					A network of high-frequency (HF) radars is deployed along the New Jersey coast providing synoptic current maps across the entire shelf. These data serve a variety of user groups from scientific research to Coast Guard search and rescue. In addition, model forecasts have been shown to improve with surface current assimilation. In all applications, there is a need for better definitions and assessment of the measurement uncertainty. During a summer coastal predictive skill experiment in 2001, an array of in situ current profilers was deployed near two HF radar sites, one long-range and one standard-range system. Comparison statistics were calculated between different vertical bins on the same current profiler, between different current profilers, and between the current profilers and the different HF radars. The velocity difference in the vertical and horizontal directions were then characterized using the observed root-mean-square (rms) differences. We further focused on two cases, one with relatively high vertical variability, and the second with relatively low vertical variability. Observed differences between the top bin of the current profiler and the HF radar were influenced by both system accuracy and the environment. Using the in situ current profilers, the environmental variability over scales based on the HF radar sampling was quantified. HF radar comparisons with the current profilers were on the same order as the observed environmental difference over the same scales, indicating that the environment has a significant influence on the observed differences. Velocity variability in the vertical and horizontal directions both contribute to these differences. When the potential effects of the vertical variability could be minimized, the remaining difference between the current profiler and the HF radar was similar to the measured horizontal velocity difference (similar to 2.5 cm/s) and below the resolution of the raw radial data at the time of the deployment.																	0364-9059					OCT	2006	31	4					876	884		10.1109/JOE.2006.886095								WOS:000244319300014

HF radar detection of tsunamis	JOURNAL OF OCEANOGRAPHY												This paper demonstrates that HF radar systems can be used to detect tsunamis well before their arrival at a coastline. We solve the equations of motion and continuity on the ocean surface using models to simulate the signals produced by a tsunami approaching the east U.S. coast. Height and velocity profiles are derived along with expressions for the radar-observed current velocities in terms of bathymetry and tsunami height and period. Simulated tsunami-gene rated radial current velocities are superimposed on typical maps of radial velocity generated by a Rutgers University HF radar system. A detection parameter is defined and plotted to quantify the progress of the tsunami, which is shown to be detectable well before its arrival at the coast. We describe observations/warnings that would have been provided by HF radar systems at locations in the path of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.																	0916-8370					OCT	2006	62	5					705	716		10.1007/s10872-006-0088-9								WOS:000240203100010

Eddy-resolving simulation of plankton ecosystem dynamics in the California Current System	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												We study the dynamics of the planktonic ecosystem in the coastal upwelling zone within the California Current System using a three-dimensional (3-D), eddy-resolving circulation model coupled to an ecosystern/biogeochemistry model. The physical model is based on the Regional Oceanic Modeling System (ROMS), configured at a resolution of 15 km for a domain covering the entire US West Coast, with an embedded child grid covering the central California upwelling region at a resolution of 5 km. The model is forced with monthly mean boundary conditions at the open lateral boundaries as well as at the surface. The ecological/biogeochemical model is nitrogen based, includes single classes for phytoplankton and zooplankton, and considers two detrital pools with different sinking speeds. The model also explicitly simulates a variable chlorophyll-to-carbon ratio. Comparisons of model results with either remote sensing observations (AVHRR, SeaWiFS) or in-situ measurements from the CalCOFI program indicate that our model is capable of replicating many of the large-scale, time-averaged features of the coastal upwelling system. An exception is the underestimation of the chlorophyll levels in the northern part of the domain, perhaps because of the lack of short-term variations in the atmospheric forcing. Another shortcoming is that the modeled thermocline is too diffuse, and that the upward slope of the isolines toward the coast is too small. Detailed time-series comparisons with observations from Monterey Bay reveal similar agreements and discrepancies. We attribute the good agreement between the modeled and observed ecological properties in large part to the accuracy of the physical fields. In turn, many of the discrepancies can be traced back to our use of monthly mean forcing. Analysis of the ecosystem structure and dynamics reveal that the magnitude and pattern of phytoplankton biomass in the nearshore region are determined largely by the balance of growth and zooplankton grazing, while in the offshore region, growth is balanced by mortality. The latter appears to be inconsistent with in situ observations and is a result of our consideration of only one zooplankton size class (mesozooplankton), neglecting the importance of microzooplankton grazing in the offshore region. A comparison of the allocation of nitrogen into the different pools of the ecosystem in the 3-D results with those obtained from a box model configuration of the same ecosystem model reveals that only a few components of the ecosystem reach a local steady-state, i.e. where biological sources and sinks balance each other. The balances for the majority of the components are achieved by local biological source and sink terms balancing the net physical divergence, confirming the importance of the 3-D nature of circulation and mixing in a coastal upwelling system.

J	Ahn, YH; Shanmugam, P				Ahn, Yu-Hwan; Shanmugam, Palanisamy			Detecting the red tide algal blooms from satellite ocean color observations in optically complex Northeast-Asia Coastal waters	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Over the last few decades, the coastal regions throughout the world have experienced incidences of algal blooms, which are harmful or otherwise toxic because of their potential threat to humans as well as marine organisms, owing to accelerated eutrophication from human activities and certain oceanic processes. Previous studies have found that correct identification of these blooms remains a great challenge with the standard bio-optical algorithms applied to satellite ocean color data in optically complex coastal waters containing high concentrations of the interfered dissolved organic and particulate inorganic materials. Here a new method called the red tide index (RI) is presented which is capable of identifying potential areas of harmful algal blooms (HABs) from SeaWiFS ocean color measurements representing the typical Case-2 water environments off the Korean and Chinese coasts. The RI method employs the water-leaving radiances (L-w), collected from in-situ radiometric measurements of three SeaWiFS bands centered at 443 nm, 5 10 nm and 555 nm, to achieve derivation of indices that are then related to absorbing characteristics of harmful algae (i.e., Lw at 443 nm) from which a best fit with a cubic polynomial function with correlation coefficient of R-2 = 0.91 is obtained providing indices of higher ranges for HABs and lower and slightly reduced ranges for turbid and non-bloom waters. Similar indices derived from the use of remote sensing reflectance (R-rs), normalized water-leaving radiance (nL(w)) and combination of both are found rather inadequate to characterize the variability of the encountered bloom. In order to quantify the HABs in terms of chlorophyll (Chl), an empirical relationship is established between the RI and in-situ Chl in surface waters from about 0.4-71 mg m(-3), which yields a Red tide index Chlorophyll Algorithm (RCA) based on an exponential function with correlation coefficient R-2 = 0.92. The established methods were extensively tested and compared with the performances of standard Ocean Chlorophyll 4 (OC4) algorithm and Local Chlorophyll Algorithm (LCA) using SeaWiFS images collected from typical red tide waters of Korean South Sea (KSS), East China Sea (ECS), Yellow Sea (YS) and Bohai Sea (BS) during 1999-2002. The standard spectral ratio algorithms, the OC4 and LCA, yielded large errors in Chl retrievals for coastal areas, besides providing false information about the encountered HABs in KSS, ECS, YS and BS waters. On the contrary, the RI coupled with the standard spectral ratios yielded comprehensive information about various ranges of algal blooms, while RCA Chl showing a good agreement with in-situ data led to enhanced understanding of the spatial and temporal variability of the recent HAB occurrences in high scattering and absorbing waters off the Korean and Chinese coasts.

Multi-seasonal spectral characteristics analysis of coastal salt marsh vegetation in Shanghai, China	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Remote sensing technology has become the primary tool for ecological research on a large scale. The spectral characteristics of the salt marsh vegetation canopy, including four main communities, Phragmites australis community, Spartina alterniflora community, Scirpus mariqueter community and Carex scabrifiolia community, were measured in the seasons of spring, summer and autumn by a ground FieldSpec (TM) Pro JR spectroradiometer, at the Chongming Dongtan Nature Reserve in Shanghai. The spectral data were converted to the reflectance curves, and their first derivative curves between 350 nm and 1000 nm were calculated. The differences in the reflectance and first derivative curves were then analyzed, with particular attention paid to the characteristics in the bands of visible, "green peak", "red edge" and near infrared. The results from this study showed that the different salt marsh communities had different and rather unique spectral characteristics during the three seasons studied. The near-ground spectral reflectance varied with the growing season, community type and its phenology. The discrimination ability, in terms of variations in the spectral reflectance, among the four major salt marsh communities was highest in autumn. It is proposed that a realistic strategy for classifying the salt marsh vegetation could be adopted by integrating and analyzing their remotely sensed images of multi-seasons. The implications of the results from this study in terms of serving as a tool for monitoring and mapping the distribution pattern and dynamics of salt marsh vegetation on the eastern coast of China are discussed.

Mapping Posidonia oceanica from IKONOS	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING												Posidonia oceanica is the dominant seagrass in the Mediterranean Sea that affects biological, biogeochemical and physical processes in Mediterranean coastal areas. The widespread loss of this species is attributed to excessive anthropic pressure and other large-scale environmental changes. Seagrass conservation requires mapping to estimate the extent of existing stocks and to measure changes over time. Optical remote sensing provides a cost-effective method to monitor vast areas of shallow waters that are potential P. oceanica habitat. As part of an interdisciplinary research effort, where the effects of these seagrasses on the hydrodynamics were investigated, new technologies of reliable, fast and effective monitoring of R oceanica were essential. This paper presents a method for using IKONOS multispectral imagery for bottom classification in a shallow coastal area of Mallorca (Balearic Islands). After applying a supervised classification, pixels are automatically classified in four classes: sand, rock, P oceanica bottoms and unclassifiable pixels. Results indicate that, in these clear waters, the spectral response of P. oceanica can be determined to a depth of about 15 m. In order to validate the method, the image classification is compared with a bottom classification derived from an acoustical survey. Agreement with the reference acoustic seabed classification is up to 84% for the sampled area. Spectral IKONOS image analysis is presented as an effective approach for monitoring P. oceanica meadows in most clear, shallow waters of the western Mediterranean.

The study area, the Fitzroy Estuary and Keppel Bay system, is a shallow coastal environment (depth < 30 m) with highly turbid waters in the estuary and blue oceanic waters in the bay and subject to macrotides. Biogeochemical and inherent optical properties (IOPs) were sampled in the near-surface layer spatially and across the tidal phase during the dry season. These determinations included continuous measurements of spectral absorption, scattering and backscattering coefficients, together with discrete measurements of spectral absorption coefficients of phytoplankton, nonalgal particles and colored dissolved organic matter, and concentrations of phytoplankton pigments and suspended matter. Because of a large variability in the characteristics of the water components on short spatial and temporal scales, we observe a large variability in the associated optical properties. From the estuary to the bay, particle scattering and dissolved absorption decreased by 2 orders of magnitude, and nonalgal particle absorption decreased by 3 orders of magnitude. We also observed a strong variability in particle single scattering albedo and backscattering efficiency (by a factor of 6) and in specific IOPs (IOPs normalized by the relevant constituent concentration) such as suspended matter-specific particle scattering and chlorophyll-specific phytoplankton absorption.

Monitoring turbid freshwater plume characteristics by means of remotely sensed data	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Remotely sensed data may provide easy access for monitoring the spatial separation and obtaining the hydrodynamic characteristics of turbid freshwater plumes created by river flow in the marine environment. Traditional methods are time consuming and require great effort to produce sufficient data. In this project, integrated research has been carried out on a river to demonstrate the utility of remote sensing (RS) technology for studying fundamental theoretical properties of turbulent mixtures. The Filyos River mouth, located on the Black Sea coast of Turkey. is the research area. Flow properties, such as the horizontal dispersion coefficient. have been calculated (using Landsat TM sensor images taken on two different dates). The effects of the plume on the morphology of neighbouring beaches are also examined. This study shows the utility of RS technology for generating quantitative data and better defining the hydraulic behaviour of a river with high turbidity.

Cloud morphology over three Indian tropical stations for earth space communication	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFRARED AND MILLIMETER WAVES												Microwave and millimeter wave frequency bands are in demand for requirement of larger bandwidth for various applications of radio systems. In future in India too, microwave and millimeter wave frequencies will be in use very extensively for radio communication purposes and remote sensing applications. But, the attenuation due to cloud as well as thermal noise associated with cloud in millimeter wave and microwave frequency bands are of great concern to system engineers and radio researchers. Both cloud attenuation and cloud noise temperature lead to degradation in the performance of microwave communication and radar propagation. The effects of rain on radio wave are more than cloud but the occurrence of cloud is more than rain. In some parts of India cloud occurs for weeks together. The cloud morphology particularly in relation to radio wave propagation over different geographical region of India is therefore very essential and important. In view of this, systematic studies on cloud occurrence morphology over different geographical locations in India have been undertaken. In recent past some results on cloud occurrences over different stations in India have been reported. In this paper, cloud characteristics and cloud attenuation over three more stations are presented. Based on low level cloud coverage observations, cloud occurrences frequency over Mumbai (19.07 degrees N, 72.51 degrees E), Nagpur (21.06 degrees N, 79.03 degrees E) and Ahmadabad (23.04 degrees N, 72.38 degrees E) situated in Indian tropical west coast, central plain and semi and region of western India in different months during daytime and nighttime has been deduced. The low-level cloud over Mumbai, Nagpur and Ahamedabad has been found to occur for many days and nights and particularly in the months of June, July, August and September. The attenuation of radio wave due to clouds at various frequencies similar to 10, 18,32,44 and 70 GHz over the aforesaid three stations also been deduced.																	0195-9271					JUL	2006	27	7					1005	1017		10.1007/s10762-006-9046-2								WOS:000242938600010

Landform and shoreline changes inferred from satellite images along the central Kerala coast	JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA												The coastal landforms and land use/land cover changes of central Kerala have been studied with the aid of topographic maps, satellite images and extensive field checks. The landforms identified are barrier islands, beach ridges and swales, strandlines, flood plains and marshy swamps. Several parallely positioned barrier islands and paleo-beach ridges reveal that the central Kerala coast has been prograding. It is observed that the evolution of coastal landforms is influenced by the fall in sea level and/or uplift of the coast. Extensive occurrence of strand line/chenier deposits supports the view that the rivers of central Kerala once have supplied enormous amount of sediments. Land use/land cover changes, which have occurred during 1966-1995 are quite alarming. The reduction of about 50% in both flood plain and river channel area is due to changes in the land use pattern. Significant changes in the shoreline and morphology of river mouths are recorded. Area of accretional shoreline is more than that of erosion-prone shoreline. Major morphological changes are observed near the Cochin inlet. The factors affecting the shoreline and landform changes are natural as well as anthropogenic. The natural processes affecting the shoreline changes are sediment supply, coastal processes, and anthropogenic activities such as dredging. Important factors affecting the land use/land cover changes are reclamation of land for agricultural and industrial purposes, and sand mining in riverbeds and paleostrandline areas.																	0016-7622					JUL	2006	68	1					35	49										WOS:000242674800004

Identification of volcanic rootless cones, ice mounds, and impact craters on Earth and Mars: Using spatial distribution as a remote sensing tool	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS												[ 1] This study aims to quantify the spatial distribution of terrestrial volcanic rootless cones and ice mounds for the purpose of identifying analogous Martian features. Using a nearest neighbor (NN) methodology, we use the statistics R ( ratio of the mean NN distance to that expected from a random distribution) and c ( a measure of departure from randomness). We interpret R as a measure of clustering and as a diagnostic for discriminating feature types. All terrestrial groups of rootless cones and ice mounds are clustered (R: 0.51 - 0.94) relative to a random distribution. Applying this same methodology to Martian feature fields of unknown origin similarly yields R of 0.57 - 0.93, indicating that their spatial distributions are consistent with both ice mound or rootless cone origins, but not impact craters. Each Martian impact crater group has R >= 1.00 (i.e., the craters are spaced at least as far apart as expected at random). Similar degrees of clustering preclude discrimination between rootless cones and ice mounds based solely on R values. However, the distribution of pairwise NN distances in each feature field shows marked differences between these two feature types in skewness and kurtosis. Terrestrial ice mounds ( skewness: 1.17 - 1.99, kurtosis: 0.80 - 4.91) tend to have more skewed and leptokurtic distributions than those of rootless cones ( skewness: 0.54 - 1.35, kurtosis: - 0.53 - 1.13). Thus NN analysis can be a powerful tool for distinguishing geological features such as rootless cones, ice mounds, and impact craters, particularly when degradation or modification precludes identification based on morphology alone.

Problematic settings in the application of the PCQM are amongst others due to the presence of multiple-stemmed trees (MST), to ambiguous settings for measuring the sampling point to nearest tree distance or the tree diameter, both of which may result in erroneous estimation of silvimetric variables and parameters. The analysis is based on a database of effective individual tree records including distances, diameters, and heights measured in the field in a Sri Lankan mangrove forest between 1997 and 2002, and randomly compiles a series of records that were used as PCQM sampling points. Various structural forest parameters were calculated, with particular emphasis on density and basal area. After proving that multiple- and single-stemmed trees have different silvimetric characteristics, we adopted an empirical approach to demonstrate the classical PCQM protocol applied to MST generates significantly different densities (overestimation) and basal areas (underestimation) depending on which stems are considered for measurement, and we suggest an adapted PCQM+ protocol (measurement of central stem instead of nearest stem). We test both protocols in two mangrove assemblages (one composed of Excoecaria agallocha only, and an Excoecaria agallochalRhizophora apiculata mixed forest) with MST proportions varying between 0% and 100%, at 5% intervals. The results indicated that the classical PCQM protocol generates density and basal area results that are strongly correlated with the MST proportion in the assemblage (p < 0.001), whereas the PCQM+ protocol shows a robustness with no such correlations for density. For basal area the results of the PCQM+ protocol showed a weak correlation with the MST proportion, and regression-ANCOVA results indicated that they were significantly different from those of the highly sensitive PCQM protocol (p < 0.001). Finally, we conclude by writing out the entire PCQM+ protocol, elaborating on the solutions to other common problems related to ambiguous settings for the consideration of stems or the measurement of their diameter (aerial roots, split trunks, dwarf growth, horizontally developing stems, boundary of an individual in MST, selectively cut trees or tree parts, very sparse assemblages, use of PCQM for remote sensing ground-truth), and by nevertheless highlighting the potential of the PCQM/PCQM+ approach. Although we used a mangrove forest data set, the PCQ-Method and our suggestions are widely applicable to other forest types. In addition, this paper is accompanied by the first interface that automatically processes standard PCQM-related data (regardless of forest type) to generate common silvimetric or forestry parameters elaborated in this paper, and it is freely available in Appendix C and from http://www.vub.ac.be/APNA/staff/FDG/pub/pub.html.

By focusing on a terrestrial landslide complex we test the operational parameters of RADARSAT-1 and the use of two-pass differential interferometry to detect change, to map its extent, and to measure the amount of movement over a given time period. RADARSAT- 1 was chosen because of its variable imaging modes and geometry. For investigations of landslide motions using remote sensing techniques, repeat-pass data are required. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry (InSAR) can ideally monitor movements across the whole surface of a landslide to a millimeteric precision, yielding a coverage significantly better than that obtained by ground instrumentation. Obtaining optimal data for InSAR analysis requires controlled orbital characteristics and imaging geometries, an understanding of the landslide characteristics and behavior, a cooperative surface, and mitigation of the factors that can affect phase. Using two-pass differential interferometry, a slope deformation map has been generated from RADARSAT- 1 data for part of the Black Ven landslide ( 2 degrees 52'W, 50 degrees 40'N), on the south coast of England. Four months separate the InSAR pair during which time 0.03 m of subsidence was measured. From this a movement rate of 0.09 m/yr can be calculated. This agrees well with ground observations and an in situ record of movement, thus demonstrating that the technique can be used to investigate landslides. With further refinement it can provide more direct measurements of landslide deformation on Earth and other planetary bodies than are currently available.																	0148-0227					JUN 14	2006	111	E6							E06S16	10.1029/2005JE002593								WOS:000238572000002

Antarctic mass rates from GRACE	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												We estimate mass trends over Antarctica using gravity variations observed by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment ( GRACE) satellite mission during its first 3.5 years ( April 2002 - November 2005). An image of surface mass trends is constructed from 1 degrees x 1 degrees pixels over the entire continent, and shows two prominent features, a region of mass loss along the coast of West Antarctica, and one of accumulation in East Antarctica. After adjusting for bias due to smoothing and to GRACE's limited spatial resolution, and removing post glacial rebound (PGR) effects, the rate in West Antarctica is - 77 +/- 14 km(3)/year, similar to a recent estimate of ice mass loss from satellite altimetry and remote sensing data. The prominent East Antarctic feature in the Enderby Land region has a rate of + 80 +/- 16 km(3)/year. Published snow/ice mass rates from remote sensing measurements indicate approximate ice mass balance in this region, suggesting that this feature is either from unquantified snow accumulation in this region or more likely due to unmodeled PGR.

This study uses a combination of satellite remote sensing, field observations, and modeling to improve our understanding of the dynamics of these flows. After examining several thousand synthetic aperture radar (SAR) high-resolution wind speed images over the Gulf of Alaska, several subclasses of barrier jets were identified that do not fit the current conceptual model of barrier jet development. This conceptual model consists of an acceleration and turning of the ambient cross-barrier flow into the along-barrier direction when the ambient low-level flow is blocked by terrain; however, the SAR imagery showed many barrier jet cases with significant flow variability in the along-coast direction as well as evidence for the influence of cold, dry continental air exiting the gaps in coastal terrain. A subclass of jets has been observed where the transition from the coastal to the offshore flow is abrupt. The results from these climatological studies have motivated modeling studies of selected events as well as field observations from the Southeast Alaska Regional Jets (SARJET) experiment field campaign in the Gulf of Alaska during fall of 2004. This paper will highlight preliminary results obtained during SARJET, which collected in situ measurements of barrier jets and gap flows using the University of Wyoming's King Air research aircraft.

On the generation and propagation of internal solitary waves in the southern Bay of Biscay	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												Internal solitary waves (ISWs), travelling towards the South-South-West (SSW), are now well documented in the northern and central Bay of Biscay. These are formed from large-amplitude internal tides which result from the interaction of the barotropic tide with the steep shelf-break topography. In the present paper, we investigate available satellite imagery (Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and ASAR data) to reveal that the southern Bay of Biscay is also a "hotspot" region which has a high level of ISW activity. Here, the ISWs travel towards the East-North-East from the Cape Finisterre region off North-West Spain. In fact, we reveal the presence of two wave-trains travelling in slightly different directions (055 degrees T and 040 degrees T). By calculating the strength of the barotropic tidal forcing in the region, and identifying the likely propagation pathways (rays) of internal tidal (IT) energy, we identify the generation sites for these wave-trains as lying on either side of the Ortegal Promontory (OP). This is an undersea "headland" projecting towards the North-West from the north-western coast of Spain (near 44 degrees N, 8.5 degrees W), and over which the barotropic tides are forced to flow. For each generation site, IT rays emanating from "critical" topography (where the ray slope is equal to the topographic slope) in regions of strong barotropic forcing, rise to the surface (for one site after a reflection from the sea-floor) and pass through the thermocline close to the earliest occurrences of the ISWs in the respective wave trains. These rays would then produce, through nonlinear processes, the ISWs through the same "local generation" mechanism that has been used to explain the occurrence of the ISWs in the northern and central Bay. The "local generation" mechanism may therefore be more widely applicable than previously thought. In addition, the methods we have used to deduce the generation sites for these waves are expected to prove equally useful for studies in other areas of the world's oceans. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Remote sensing analysis identified predisaster mangrove change and postdisaster structural damage and landscape changes. Field data from five sites (20 villages), gathered via the VIEWS (TM) data collection system, validated and supplemented this analysis. Key informants at several of these villages were also interviewed. A preliminary comparison of villages that otherwise faced similar tsunami exposure suggests that the presence of healthy mangroves did afford substantial protection. Village performance in mangrove conservation and management efforts, and thus the presence of healthy forests, is influenced by both social capital and the design of external aid delivery programs.																	8755-2930					JUN	2006	22			3			S863	S887		10.1193/1.2201971								WOS:000251517100044

During the past three decades, these mangrove areas have been reduced to about 50% with less than 10% left on the east coast. Coastal erosion and accretion occur irregularly along the coast but an intensification of erosion has been noticed during the past decade. This study assessed the relationship between mangrove presence and changes in coastal area. Mangrove colonization rates were assessed using in situ transects and remote sensing time series. Both methods led to comparable estimates ranging between 5 and 40 m y(-1). Quantitative data on changes of coastal segments along southern Thai coastlines as well as available possible factors responsible for these changes were compiled. Overall, net erosion prevailed (1.3 +/- 0.4 m y(-1)). The Gulf of Thailand coastline in the East of the country was found to be most dynamic: change occurred along more coastal segments than in the West (43% vs. 16%). Rates of erosion and accretion were also higher, 3.6 versus 2.9 m y(-1) and 2.6 versus 1.5 m y(-1), respectively. Total area losses accounted for 0.91 km(2) y(-1) for the Gulf coast and 0.25 km(2) y(-1) for the West. Coasts with and without mangroves behaved differently: in the presence of mangroves less erosion was observed whilst expansion occurred at particular coastal types with mangrove existence, i.e. river mouths and sheltered bays. Possible underlying causes were examined using multivariate analysis. Eroded areas were found to increase with increased area of shrimp farms, increased fetch to the prevailing monsoon, and when dams reduced riverine inputs. Notably, however, in areas where erosion prevailed, the presence of mangroves reduced these erosion rates. Mangrove loss was found to be higher in the presence of shrimp farms and in areas where mangrove forests used to be extensive in the past. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The commercial fishery consists of a multinational jigging fleet and the emission of light from these vessels can be observed using satellite-derived imagery obtained by the United States Defence Meteorological Satellite Program-Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS). Fishery abundance and fleet distribution were examined in Peruvian waters during years of intermediate (1994), La Nina (1996), and El Nino (1997) conditions, and compared with catch data from other parts of the species range (to the north and south of Peru). Squid catches off Peru were highest under intermediate conditions, with lower catch levels recorded during periods of cool or warm temperature anomalies. The fishery was distributed between 3 degrees and 16 degrees S in both coastal and high seas waters, over depths of greater than 1000 m. Unusually cool or warm conditions may cause a reduction in the abundance of squid off the coast of Peru, with catches increasing in other parts of the species range, notably off the coast of Central America (close to the Costa Rica Dome) and in the Gulf of California, Mexico. Squid fishing took place in waters with sea surface temperatures (SSTs) between 17 and 22 degrees C, but SST was not directly associated with fleet distribution. It is likely that variability in upwelling strength and the occurrence of cool core mesoscale oceanographic features are important in influencing the distribution of D. gigas in Peruvian waters.

The algorithm described is applicable to ocean colour satellite measurements (e.g., SeaWiFS). In situ measurements of inherent and apparent optical properties were made at 19 coastal stations off the north coast of New Zealand's South Island in December 2001. These measurements were used to parameterise a bio-optical model that estimates remote sensing reflectance from concentrations of water constituents. The model generated a large number (5000) of modelled ocean colour reflectance spectra that represented a greater range of biogeochemical conditions than were measured in the study area. These modelled values spanned a wide range of chlorophyll concentrations (0.1-10 mg m(-3)), total suspended particulate material concentrations (0.1-50 g m(-3)), and dissolved yellow substance absorptions (0.01-3m(-1)). The modelled spectra were then used to test the performance of the algorithm. The median ratio of algorithm values to target values was 0.84 (absorption), and 0.80 (backscatter), and the median absolute errors were 33% (absorption) and 36% (backscatter) across two orders of magnitude. The r(2) values between target and algorithm values of inherent optical properties in log-log space were 0.89 for backscatter, and varied with wavelength for absorption from 0.79 (412 nm), 0.72 (443 nm), 0.63 (490 nm), 0.55 (510 nm), and 0.21 (555 nm).				oubelkheir, kadija/H-3843-2011; Boyd, Philip/J-7624-2014	Boyd, Philip/0000-0001-7850-1911; Lavender, Samantha/0000-0002-5181-9425; Moore, Gerald/0000-0001-6170-6646												0028-8330					JUN	2006	40	2					227	247		10.1080/00288330.2006.9517417								WOS:000239326700002

Harmonic analysis and monthly means in ocean color indicate that during the southeast Asia-Australia monsoon southeasterly wind from Australia generates upwelling and brings cooler and nutrient-rich water near the surface, enhancing productivity and increasing ocean color in the Banda Sea and the southern coasts of Jawa (Java)-Sumatra. Conditions are reversed during the northwest monsoon. The northwest wind induces downwelling and produces a weaker biological response in terms of ocean color. Anomalous winds associated with the 1997-1998 El Nino/La Nina events coinciding with the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) produced significant departures from the 6-year monthly mean in both magnitude and timing of the seasonal response to the southeast monsoon. Ocean color intensified in the upwelling region along the southern coast of Jawa-Sumatra, and the area of increased amplitude extended westward and prolonged the southeast monsoon period. In addition, localized minimum values of ocean color are observed along the exit pathways of the Indonesian Throughflow.

Results Three main plant species dominated the low and middle intertidal saltmarsh, Spartina alterniflora Loesel., Spartina densiflora Brong. and Sarcocornia perennis (P. Mill.) A.J. Scott. The total area of the studied coastal saltmarshes was 2133 km(2), comprising 380 km(2) of Sp. alterniflora marsh, 366 km(2) of Sp. densiflora marsh, 746 km(2) of Sar. perennis marsh and 641 km(2) of brackish marsh (dominated by Juncus acutus L., Juncus kraussii Hochst., Scirpus maritimus L., Scirpus americanus Pers. and Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin.). Cluster analysis showed three habitat types: saltmarshes dominated by (1) Sp. densiflora and brackish species,(2) Sp. alterniflora and Sar. perennis and (3) Sp.densiflora only. The analysis of abiotic variables showed significant differences between groups of habitats and coordinated gradients of the abiotic variables. The south-west Atlantic coast showed decreasing mean annual rainfall (1200 to 196 mm) and increasing mean tidal amplitude (< 0.5 to > 2.5 m) from latitude 31 degrees to 43 degrees. Main conclusions South-west Atlantic saltmarshes are globally important by virtue of their total extent. Remote sensing showed that the reversal pattern in plant distribution is not widespread. Indeed, south-west Atlantic saltmarshes are better characterized by the presence of the halophytic genera Spartina and Sarcocornia. Our results support the interpretation that south-west Atlantic saltmarshes constitute a class of temperate type (sensu Adam, 1990) with transitional characteristics between Australasian-South African saltmarshes and west Atlantic saltmarshes.

J	Ramasamy, SM				Ramasamy, S. M.			Holocene tectonics revealed by Tamil Nadu deltas, India	JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA					National Seminar on Deltas of India	2005	Univ Andhra, Geol Dept, Visakhapatnam, INDIA	Geol Soc India	Univ Andhra, Geol Dept			Overall geological histories of the Quaternary deltas of all over the world have been studied considerably, to understand the evolution, eustatic-isostatic changes, land-ocean interactive phenomehon, resources, environment etc. But tectonic signatures of these deltas have been less studied, though these have significance in understanding the natural resources, environment and evaluation of natural disasters. In this context, as the state of Tamil Nadu is a low easterly gradient plain, all the easterly flowing rivers have developed well evolved geomorphic features related to youthful, mature and old stages. Such old stages of the rivers are marked by the spectacular development of deltas. These deltas of Tamil Nadu have been studied in detail for understanding the tectonics with the help of visibly seen tectonic and geomorphic features in satellite based remote sensing and ground based data sets. The study has revealed that the upper age limit/ages of these deltas are probably of Middle to Late Holocene and the various tectonic and geomorphic anomalies observed in these deltas obviously indicate the tectonic processes/phenomena that prevailed during Middle Holocene-till date. The Proto Cauvery delta of Chennai region is witnessing ongoing NE-SW sinistral, NW-SE dextral and E-W vertical tectonic activities. The streams in Ponnaiyar delta are showing persistent southerly migration due to the probable ongoing land subsidence along NE-SW faults in the southern part of the delta. The Cauvery river which has originally developed a broad bird-foot shaped-arcuate delta, has undergone a phase of anticlockwise rotational migration and stabilized in the northern rim of the delta as Coleroon river during 2300-750 Y.B.P. due to the ongoing tectonic emergence in the south of the delta almost since the last 6000 years or so. The Vellar river, in deltaic regime, shows northerly migration due to E-W grabening in the northern part of the delta. Vaigai and Manimuttar rivers are again migrating northerly in their deltaic regions due to the probable land arching to the south of their present day flow. Thus, the paper discusses the post deltaic/Middle-Late Holocene geological processes of Tamil Nadu deltas which are predominated by tectonic activities.																	0016-7622					MAY	2006	67	5					637	648										WOS:000244278300011

Late Holocene geomorphic evolution of Cauvery delta, Tamil Nadu	JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA					National Seminar on Deltas of India	2005	Univ Andhra, Geol Dept, Visakhapatnam, INDIA	Geol Soc India	Univ Andhra, Geol Dept			The Cauvery delta is a major bird-loot shaped delta with its apex located east of Tiruchirappalli with the mother channel Cauvery flowing along Thanjavur-Kumbakonam-Kaveripoompattinam. The distributary drainages are radiating over all are towards cast from its apex with a fan shape and finally debouch into the sea from South of Tiruthuraipoondi in the South to Kaveripoompattinam in the north. All these distributary drainages are now seen as palaeochannels including the mother channel Cauvery, Which is now called as "Palam Cauvery". The present day flow of Cauvery river is confined to the northernmost rim of the delta as river Coleroon. Oil the basis of the archaeological, epigraphic and historical data analysed earlier and the C-14 dating carried Out recently, the present authors infer that the age of the delta may vary from 2300 Y.B.P. (Years Before Present) to 750 Y.B.P. and the age of the palaeochannels are also younging from 2300 Y.B.P. in the south to 750 Y.B.P. in the north. In the Southern part of the Cauvery delta, the Mio-Pliocene Sandstone of Pattukottai-Mannargudi area is undergoing upliftment along N-S Faults. On the basis of the rapid land progradation during 6085 +/- 233 Y.B.P.-1020 +/- 80 Y.B.P. in Vedaranniyam coast, it is Visualized that the Mio-Pliocene Sandstone must be undergoing upliftment significantly since 6100 Y.B.P. onwards. On the basis of the occurrence of older palaeochannels in the south, the gradual younging palaeochannels towards the north and the land emergence in the South of file Cauvery delta in Pattukottai-Mannargudi area, it is concluded that the distributary drainages of river Cauvery would have become Sequentially defunct/shilfted from south to north and finally the mother channel Cauvery also Would have been Pushed towards north to reach the present tract of Coleroon river. The thinner palaeochannels in the South and the gradual wider palaeochannels in the north of the delta further indicate that as the land was already undergoing emergence ill the South even before the river Cauvery had entered into Thanjavur plains, file river Could not comfortably spread its distributaries in the South. Hence, the Southern distributaries, after a brief flow, would have started drying sequentially from south to north during 2300-750 Y.B.P. thereby the floodwater of each of the southern distributary channel would have been pushed to its successive northern Counterpart, i.e. the Southern distributary (say 1), Pushing its water to its immediate northern counterpart (say 2), then the combined flow of I and 2 pushing the water to 3 and so on. The anomalous eyed drainage and its modifications during the last 50-60 years and compressed meanders in Coleroon river, deflected drainages in Palam Cauvery, truncation and punctuation of beach ridges by the E-W faults along the N-S coast and Such fault acting as pathways for the sub parallel creeks indicate vibrant Late Holocene geological history predominated by the tectonic movements in Cauvery delta.					radhakrishnan, selvakumar/0000-0002-1635-8977												0016-7622					MAY	2006	67	5					649	657										WOS:000244278300012						
J	Chen, MH; Deng, ZH; Yang, ZZ; Ma, XJ				Chen, MH; Deng, ZH; Yang, ZZ; Ma, XJ			Surface latent heat flux anomalies prior to the Indonesia Mw9.0 earthquake of 2004	CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN												The temporal and spatial variations of surface latent heat flux (SLHF) before and after the Mw9.0 earthquake that occurred on the west coast of Sumatra, Indonesia on 26 December 2004 are summarized. It is found that before the earthquake significant SLHF anomalies occurred at the epicentral area and its vicinity. The largest SLHF anomaly occurred on the subduction zone in the middle part of Burma micro-plate, where the middle part of the rupture zone is located and the aftershocks are concentrated. The developments of the anomaly involved growing of the anomaly from small to large and spreading of the anomaly from disordered to concentrated. The anomaly began to occur on the east extensional boundary of the Burma micro-plate and its adjacent oceanic basin, and then propagated to the west compressive boundary, where the subduction zone exists. Finally, the anomaly disappeared after the main shock. The seismic source is considered to be a dissipation system. The increase of stress prior to an earthquake may enhance the exchange of energy and material between the seismic source system and the outer system, resulting in the increase of the rate of energy exchange between sea surface and atmosphere, which is believed to be the main reason of the generation of SLHF anomaly.																	1001-6538					APR	2006	51	8					1010	1013		10.1007/s11434-006-1010-y								WOS:000238600700019						
J	Goetze, D; Horsch, B; Porembski, S				Goetze, D; Horsch, B; Porembski, S			Dynamics of forest-savanna mosaics in north-eastern Ivory Coast from 1954 to 2002	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim In the transition between the southern Sudanian and northern Guinean zones of West Africa, numerous islands of predominantly semi-deciduous forests are interspersed in extensive savannas. During the past decades, human population and intensity of land use have increased. At the same time, almost nothing is known about the natural dynamics of this widespread forest-savanna mosaic and how they are altered by human activities. This was investigated with respect to past, present and future forest-savanna dynamics, which presumably influence northern Guinean biodiversity. Location The Comoe National Park (CNP) region in north-eastern Ivory Coast. Methods Landscape dynamics and the rates of anthropogenic deforestation and natural reforestation were retrospectively analysed by means of historical and recent aerial photographs and satellite images, directly relating the semi-natural conditions in the CNP to neighbouring, traditionally utilized countryside. Results From 1954 to 1996, the studied forest-savanna pattern proved to be remarkably stable, even with extensive land utilization outside the CNP. The contour towards the surrounding savanna and, thus, the size of 95.4% of 653 forest islands remained unchanged. Unvegetated surfaces also remained remarkably constant during the period from 1967 to 1996. Although dynamics were clearly higher outside the CNP as a result of human activities, the 913 unvegetated surfaces studied showed no general trend of decrease or increase, i.e. there was no response over the study period to an identified climatic shift. Anthropogenic deforestation and subsequent natural reforestation within the contours of the existing forest have occurred to a noteworthy extent only outside the CNP. For the period 1988-2002, the extent of deforestation was greater than the extent of reforestation (40% vs. 14%). By 2002, 62% of the original gallery forest along a 75-km section of the Comoe river had been cleared. Main conclusions With its remarkable overall stability, the landscape pattern inside the CNP has responded with resilience to varying influences (in particular climatic variations) and disturbances (e.g. episodic mass herbivory). A possible natural succession from savanna to forest appears to proceed only very slowly due to the counteracting effects of annual savanna fires and the lower climatic humidity of the area compared to the southern Guinean zone. Consequently, the forests should be considered as habitat islands rather than as habitat fragments. As deforestation outside the CNP has increased considerably, the pre-existing pattern of forest insularization is now becoming overlain in these non-CNP areas by a pattern of forest fragmentation. This will aggravate the ecological and genetic isolation of the undisturbed forests in the CNP, which are among the last remaining natural forests of the entire Guineo-Sudanian transition zone.																	0305-0270					APR	2006	33	4					653	664		10.1111/j.1365-2699.2005.01312.x								WOS:000236247200009

Ground-based electromagnetic studies combined with remote sensing based on Demeter mission: A way to monitor active faults and volcanoes	PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE												The identification of magnetic, electric and electromagnetic (EM) precursory signals related to volcanic activities and earthquakes is still a matter of debate. Some examples are now well established, but they are often based on a few parameters recorded on sparse equipments and with no multi-disciplinary approach. Demeter program takes into account a more complete approach of EM phenomena related to volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, by combining both ground-based and satellite EM monitoring, from direct current to several kilohertz, i.e. from ULF, ELF to VLF frequency domains. The research program stands in two parts: one is the identification of EM signals at the satellite altitude and the other consists in detailed studies in a few pilot sites on the ground. Two main test sites have been considered: La Fournaise volcano in Reunion Island and the seismogenic Corinth rift in Greece. Both sites allow for performing EM studies in a multi-disciplinary environment. La Fournaise volcano erupts on average two times a year. The self-recording Demeter EM station is composed of three modules measuring the components of the magnetic and electric fields in three different frequency domains: DC to 0.5 Hz, 0.0033-160 Hz and 8-10 kHz. Preliminary observations made during the May 2003 eruption show that electric and magnetic signals appeared before the eruption. Some signals present sharp step-like variations, with amplitudes up to several hundreds mV per km and a few hour duration, followed by periods with a higher spectral frequency content. The frequency of these signals can be of several tens of Hz. The Corinth rift is a highly seismic area, frequently affected by seismic swarms. In 2004 the region has experienced tens of earthquakes of magnitude less than 4.6. A Demeter station has been set up on the Trizonia Island along the northern mainland coast, where a 30 km long seismic gap has been identified. The station is composed of two modules recording the three components of the magnetic field and the two horizontal components of the electric field in the ULF and ELF-VLF frequency bands. The audiomagnetotelluric soundings show that the station is close to a regional conductive fault connected to the sea. The first 4 months of observation clearly show that 29 earthquakes, even of low magnitude (M >= 2.8), occurring at less than 140km of distance of the station, have generated electric signals when the seismic waves have passed the EM station. For a given magnitude of the earthquake, the energy of the electric signal is independent of the distance between the focal source and the EM station, which points out local electric source mechanisms. The greater the magnitude of the earthquake, the greater is the energy of the electric signal is. The co-seismic electric signals have the same morphology as that of the passing seismic wave, and there is no noticeable time delay between the electric and the seismic signals. This simultaneity between the seismic and the electric signal is best explained by the generation of an electrokinetic effect due to the passage of the seismic wave through the seawater-saturated ground.

J	Chu, ZX; Sun, XG; Zhai, SK; Xu, KH				Chu, ZX; Sun, XG; Zhai, SK; Xu, KH			Changing pattern of accretion/erosion of the modem Yellow River (Huanghe) subaerial delta, China: Based on remote sensing images	MARINE GEOLOGY												The Yellow River shifted from the Diaokou course to the Qingshuigou course in 1976, and shifted again at the north bank of the Qingshuigou course in 1996. As a result, the entire modem Yellow River Delta has experienced complicated patterns of erosion and accretion. Multitemporal remote sensing data of Landsat MSS and TM from 1976 to 2000, totaling twenty scenes, were used to examine the changing pattern of accretion and erosion of the modem Yellow River subaerial delta with GIS tools. During the period 1976 to 2000, the maximum erosion occurred at the head of the last two abandoned promontories, Diaokou and Shenxiangou promontories, where the coastline retreated landward over -7 and -4.5 km, respectively, with mean net erosion rates of -0.29 and -0.19 km/a, respectively. In contrast, the maximum accretion occurred at the head of the Qingshuigou Promontory where the coastline advanced seaward over 20 km with a mean net accretion rate of 0.83 km/a. The coastline at the head of the Q(8) Promontory also advanced seaward 7 km with a mean net accretion rate of 0.29 km/a during the period 1996 to 2000. Total area of the Diaokou and Shenxiangou promontories was reduced by -141.3 km(2) with a mean net erosion rate of -6.03 km(2)/a. Total area of the Qingshuigou and Q(8) promontories increased by 384.16 and 11.88 km(2), respectively, with mean net accretion rates of 16.4 and 3.03 km(2)/a, respectively. Relative to the Diaokou, Shenxiangou and Qingshuigou promontories, the west area of the Diaokou Promontory and south area of the Qingshuigou Promontory were relatively stable, although minor erosion occurred. The general pattern of accretion and erosion of the modem Yellow River subaerial delta was divided into three stages: rapid accretion stage (1976-1984), accretion-erosion adjustment stage (1985-1995), and slow erosion stage (1996-present). The factors affecting the pattern of erosion and accretion over the Yellow River Delta, such as structural geology, the Yellow River sediment discharge, coastal processes, meteorological conditions, human activity, sea level rise and land subsidence were summarized. The cumulative area of increase over the entire subaerial delta is closely correlated with the cumulative Yellow River sediment discharge. Wave-induced longshore current is the major driving force to transport sediment from eroded areas along the last two abandoned promontories, Diaokou and Shenxiangou promontories, mostly westerly and partially easterly. Together with these coastal processes is the geographical shift of the Yellow River course associated with its discharge regime after 1976, leading to the accretion along the present Qingshuigou Promontory and then the Q(8) Promontory.

Most of the measurements were obtained in relatively clean air dominated by airflows that had passed over Canada and the northern Atlantic Ocean. Results from the 17 July and 2 August 2001 flights are presented; on these days, the aerosol loading was relatively high. In the lower troposphere, omega(0) values at a wavelength of 550 nm were consistently above 0.93 throughout the field experiment, indicating the dominance of weakly absorbing aerosol. Particle number size distributions are presented and discussed for transects at altitudes similar to 0.05-3.5 km above mean sea level. Particles with diameters (D-p) < 0.1 mu m made up the majority of the aerosol number. Accumulation mode particles dominate the number size, surface area, and volume distributions. The variability of optical and physical aerosol parameters was analyzed on horizontal scales of similar to 1-4 km. There was little horizontal variability in the single-scattering albedo (w(0)), aerosol optical depth (AOD), and accumulation mode size, but greater variability in particle number concentration. Comparisons of the airborne measurements with remotely sensed aerosol parameters, such as omega(0) and effective particle radius (r(etf)), derived from the Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) aboard the Terra satellite were generally in good agreement. Overall, the MISR retrievals captured both the similarities and the differences between the properties of the aerosols measured on 17 July and 2 August.

It is necessary to evaluate land use - land cover (LULC) changes to develop efficient management strategies. The main objective of this paper is to evaluate and quantity Abu Dhabi coastal zone LULC changes from 1972 to 2000 using multi-temporal LANDSAT satellite data and digital change detection techniques. Supervised classification Coupled with expert Visual interpretation techniques were used to produce LULC classified images with an accuracy of 88%. Change detection process was achieved by applying post-classification comparison techniques in ENVI software. From this study it has been observed that the important coastal landuse types of Abu Dhabi coast i.e. wetlands and woody Vegetation (Mangrove, represented by a single species, Avicennia marina) have been reduced drastically in their extent due to reclamation, dredging, tipping and other anthropogenic activities along the coastal zone. However, it has been observed that there is rapid increase in the man-made plantation and managed vegetation from 1990 to 2000 due to the Abu Dhabi government initiation. This Study has given good insight into Abu Dhabi coastal zone changes during last 3 decades.				CHEN, YU/F-8600-2011	Yagoub, M.

The objective of the present study is to understand dynamic features of the phytoplankton biology in the GoT and the nearby SCS, on both sides of the Indochina Peninsula, using remote-sensing measurements of chlorophyll-a (Ch1 a), sea surface temperature (SST), and surface vector winds obtained during the period from September 1997 to March 2003. Results show that seasonal variations of the phytoplankton blooms are primarily controlled by the monsoonal winds and related coastal environments. The GoT and the near-coastal SCS have a peak in the averaged monthly Ch1 a in December and January, which is associated with the winter northeaster monsoon. The near-coastal SCS have another big peak in the averaged monthly Ch1 a in summer (July to September), which is associated with the summer southwest monsoon. The offshore bloom in the GoT occurs in its southern part and enhances the December-January peak of averaged monthly Ch1 a. By contrast, the offshore bloom in the nearby SCS is observed northeast of the Peninsula, and represents the primary source of the July-September peak Ch1 a. Here the coastal upwelling associated with the offshore Ekman transport caused by the coastal surface winds parallel to the Vietnam east coast gives physical conditions favorable to the development of offshore phytoplankton blooms. The Mekong River discharge waters flow in different directions, depending on the monsoon winds, and contributes to seasonal blooms on both sides of the Peninsula.

Uplift and subsidence associated with the great Aceh-Andaman earthquake of 2004	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH												Rupture of the Sunda megathrust on 26 December 2004 produced broad regions of uplift and subsidence. We define the pivot line separating these regions as a first step in defining the lateral extent and the downdip limit of rupture during that great M-w approximate to 9.2 earthquake. In the region of the Andaman and Nicobar islands we rely exclusively on the interpretation of satellite imagery and a tidal model. At the southern limit of the great rupture we rely principally on field measurements of emerged coral microatolls. Uplift extends from the middle of Simeulue Island, Sumatra, at similar to 2.5 degrees N, to Preparis Island, Myanmar (Burma), at similar to 14.9 degrees N. Thus the rupture is similar to 1600 km long. The distance from the pivot line to the trench varies appreciably. The northern and western Andaman Islands rose, whereas the southern and eastern portion of the islands subsided. The Nicobar Islands and the west coast of Aceh province, Sumatra, subsided. Tilt at the southern end of the rupture is steep; the distance from 1.5 m of uplift to the pivot line is just 60 km. Our method of using satellite imagery to recognize changes in elevation relative to sea surface height and of using a tidal model to place quantitative bounds on coseismic uplift or subsidence is a novel approach that can be adapted to other forms of remote sensing and can be applied to other subduction zones in tropical regions.

In this paper we introduce the results from a remote sensing campaign performed in September 2001 at night time. For the first time nocturnal light pollution was measured at high spatial and spectral resolution using two airborne hyperspectral sensors, namely the Multispectral Infrared and Visible Imaging Spectrometer (MIVIS) and the Visible InfraRed Scanner (VIRS-200). These imagers, generally employed for day-time Earth remote sensing, were flown over the Tuscany coast (Italy) on board of a Casa 212/200 airplane from an altitude of 1.5-2.0 km. We describe the experimental activities which preceded the remote sensing campaign, the optimization of sensor configuration, and the images as far acquired. The obtained results point out the novelty of the performed measurements and highlight the need to employ advanced remote sensing techniques as a spectroscopic tool for light pollution monitoring.

J	Menon, HB; Lotliker, AA; Nayak, SR				Menon, HB; Lotliker, AA; Nayak, SR			Analysis of estuarine colour components during non-monsoon period through Ocean Colour Monitor	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Simultaneous acquisition of water samples, radiance and irradiance measurements were carried out from 40 stations in the Mandovi-Zuari estuaries during February to May 2002. From the samples collected, inherent and apparent optical properties (IOP and AOP) such as absorption coefficient (a), upwelling diffuse attenuation coefficient (k(u)) and subsurface reflectance (R) were derived. Using these optical properties, radiative transfer at each water column is examined. On the basis of the radiative transfer outcome, band-ratio algorithms are derived for three optically active substances (OAS), viz, chlorophyll-a, suspended sediment and coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM). The respective algorithms are 670/555, 490/670 and 412/670 nm for chlorophyll-a, suspended sediment and CDOM.

JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												[1] The recent Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Aerosol Intensive Operations Period (AIOP, May 2003) yielded one of the best measurement sets obtained to date to assess our ability to measure the vertical profile of ambient aerosol extinction sigma(ep)(lambda) in the lower troposphere. During one month, a heavily instrumented aircraft with well-characterized aerosol sampling ability carrying well-proven and new aerosol instrumentation devoted most of the 60 available flight hours to flying vertical profiles over the heavily instrumented ARM Southern Great Plains (SGP) Climate Research Facility (CRF). This allowed us to compare vertical extinction profiles obtained from six different instruments: airborne Sun photometer (AATS-14), airborne nephelometer/absorption photometer, airborne cavity ring-down system, ground-based Raman lidar, and two ground-based elastic backscatter lidars. We find the in situ measured sigma(ep)(lambda) to be lower than the AATS-14 derived values. Bias differences are 0.002-0.004 Km(-1) equivalent to 13-17% in the visible, or 45% in the near-infrared. On the other hand, we find that with respect to AATS-14, the lidar sigma(ep)(lambda) are higher: Bias differences are 0.004 Km(-1) (13%) and 0.007 Km(-1) (24%) for the two elastic backscatter lidars (MPLNET and MPLARM, lambda = 523 nm) and 0.029 Km(-1) (54%) for the Raman lidar (lambda = 355 nm). An unnoticed loss of sensitivity of the Raman lidar had occurred leading up to AIOP, and we expect better agreement from the recently restored system. Looking at the collective results from six field campaigns conducted since 1996, airborne in situ measurements of sigma(ep)(lambda) tend to be biased slightly low (17% at visible wavelengths) when compared to airborne Sun photometer sigma(ep)(lambda). On the other hand, sigma(ep)(lambda) values derived from lidars tend to have no or positive biases. From the bias differences we conclude that the typical systematic error associated with measuring the tropospheric vertical profile of the ambient aerosol extinction with current state-of-the-art instrumentation is 15-20% at visible wavelengths and potentially larger in the UV and near-infrared.

J	Zoran, M; Andersona, E				Zoran, M; Andersona, E			The use of multi-temporal and multispectral satellite data for change detection analysis of the Romanian Black Sea coastal zone	JOURNAL OF OPTOELECTRONICS AND ADVANCED MATERIALS					6th International Balkan Workshop on Applied Physics	JUL 05-07, 2005	Constanta, ROMANIA	Balkan Phys Union, Romanian Phys Soc, Romanian Minist Educ & Res, Ovidius Univ Constanta, Fac Phys, Chem & Petr Technol, Univ Bucharest, Fac Phys, Romanian Mat Sci, Crystal Growth Soc				The Romanian North Western coastal and shelf zones of the Black Sea and Danube delta are a mosaic of complex, interacting ecosystems, rich natural resources and socio-economic activity. Dramatic changes in the Black Sea's ecosystem and resources are due to natural and anthropogenic causes (increase in the nutrient and pollutant load of rivers input, industrial and municipal wastewater pollution along the coast, and dumping on the open sea). A scientific management system for protection, conservation and restoration must be based on reliable information on bio-geophysical and geomorphologic processes, coastal erosion, sedimentation dynamics, mapping of macrophyte fields, water quality, climatic change effects. Synergetic use of quasi-simultaneously acquired multi-sensor data may therefore allow for a better approach of change detection of coastal area. This paper is an application of multi-temporal and multi-spectral satellite remotely sensed data (Landsat MSS, TM, ETM, SAR ERS, ASTER, MODIS) over a period of time between 1975 and 2003 for North-Western Black Sea coastal zone change detection assessment. Spectral mixture analysis, supervised and unsupervised classification are used to study chosen test areas. The results can be utilized as a temporal land-use change model for a region to quantify the extent and nature of change, and aid in future prediction studies, which helps in planning environmental agencies to develop sustainable land-use practices.																	1454-4164					FEB	2006	8	1					252	256										WOS:000236107300056

The automated algorithms used to derive these profiles from the Raman lidar data were first modified to reduce the adverse effects associated with a general loss of sensitivity of the Raman lidar since early 2002. The Raman lidar water vapor measurements, which are calibrated to match precipitable water vapor (PWV) derived from coincident microwave radiometer (MWR) measurements were, on average, 5 - 10% (0.3 - 0.6 g/m(3)) higher than the other measurements. Some of this difference is due to out-of-date line parameters that were subsequently updated in the MWR PWV retrievals. The Raman lidar aerosol extinction measurements were, on average, about 0.03 km(-1) higher than aerosol measurements derived from airborne Sun photometer measurements of aerosol optical thickness and in situ measurements of aerosol scattering and absorption. This bias, which was about 50% of the mean aerosol extinction measured during this IOP, decreased to about 10% when aerosol extinction comparisons were restricted to aerosol extinction values larger than 0.15 km(-1). The lidar measurements of the aerosol extinction/ backscatter ratio and airborne Sun photometer measurements of the aerosol optical thickness were used along with in situ measurements of the aerosol size distribution to retrieve estimates of the aerosol single scattering albedo (omega(o)) and the effective complex refractive index. Retrieved values of omega(o) ranged from (0.91 - 0.98) and were in generally good agreement with omega(o) derived from airborne in situ measurements of scattering and absorption. Elevated aerosol layers located between about 2.6 and 3.6 km were observed by the Raman lidar on 25 and 27 May. The airborne measurements and lidar retrievals indicated that these layers, which were likely smoke produced by Siberian forest fires, were primarily composed of relatively large particles (r(eff) similar to 0.23 mu m) and that the layers were relatively nonabsorbing (omega(o) similar to 0.96 - 0.98). Preliminary results show that major modifications that were made to the Raman lidar system during 2004 have dramatically improved the sensitivity in the aerosol and water vapor channels and reduced random errors in the aerosol scattering ratio and water vapor retrievals by an order of magnitude.				andrews, elisabeth/A-7104-2018; Ogren, John/M-8255-2015	andrews, elisabeth/0000-0002-9394-024X; Ogren, John/0000-0002-7895-9583												2169-897X	2169-8996				JAN 25	2006	111	D5							D05S08	10.1029/2005JD005836								WOS:000235027100001						
J	Wang, AJ; Gao, S; Ja, JJ				Wang Aijun; Gao Shu; Ja Jianjun			Impact of the cord-grass Spartina alterniflora on sedimentary, and morphological evolution of tidal salt marshes on the Jiangsu coast, China	ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA												The tidal flats of the Wanggang area, on the Jiangsu coast, represent the largest continuously distributed coastal wetland in terms of area coverage in China, and the dynamics of tidal flat accretion and erosion is highly complicated. The cord-grass Spartina alterniflora, which was introduced artificially into the Jiangsu coast, has significant influences on the regional tidal flat evolution in terms of deposition rate, spacial sediment distribution patterns and tidal creek morphology. On the basis of the data set of bed elevation and accumulation rate for different periods of time, the applicability of the Pethick - Allen model to the Jiangsu tidal salt marshes is discussed. In addition, caesium-137 dating was carried out for sediment samples collected from the salt marsh of the Wangang area. In combination with the caesium-137 analysis and the data collected from literature, the Pethick - Allen model was used to derive the accumulation rate in the Wanggang tidal flat for the various periods. The results show that the pattern of tidal flat accretion has been modified, due to more rapid accretion following the introduction of S. alterniflora to the region. Surficial sediment samples were collected from representative profiles and analyzed for grain size with a laser particle analyzer. The result shows that fine-grained sediment has been trapped by the plant, with most of the sediment deposited on the Suaeda salsa and Spartina angelica flats being derived from drainage creeks rather than the from gently sloping tidal flats. Remote sensing analysis and in situ observations indicate that the creeks formed in the S. alterniflora flat have a relatively small ratio of width to depth, a relatively high density, and are more stable than the other tidal flat creek systems in the study area.																	0253-505X						2006	25	4					32	42										WOS:000240112900004

Investigation of local meteorological events and their relationship with ozone and aerosols during an ESCOMPTE photochemical episode	ANNALES GEOPHYSICAE												The international ESCOMPTE campaign, which took place in summer 2001 in the most highly polluted French region, was devoted to validate air pollution prediction models. Surface and remote sensing instruments (Lidar, Radar and Sodar) were deployed over the Marseille area, along the Mediterranean coast, in order to investigate the fine structure of the sea-breeze circulation and its relationship with the pollutant concentrations. The geographical situation of the Marseille region combines a complex coastline and relief which both lead to a peculiar behaviour of the sea-breeze circulation. Several local sea breezes, perpendicular to the nearest coastline, settled in during the morning. In the afternoons, when the thermal gradient between the continental and marine surface grows up, a southerly or a westerly sea breeze may dominate. Their respective importance is then a function of time, space and altitude. Furthermore, an oscillation of the westerly sea breeze with a period of about 3 h is also highlighted. We show that these dynamical characteristics have profound influences on the atmospheric boundary-layer (ABL) development and on pollutant concentrations. In fact, the direction and intensity of the sea-breeze determine the route and the transit time of the stable marine air flow over the continental surface. Thus, the ABL depth may exhibit several collapses correlated with the westerly sea-breeze pulsation. The ozone and aerosol concentrations are also related to the dynamical features. In the suburbs and parts of the city under pulsed sea breezes, a higher ABL depth and higher ozone concentrations are observed. In the city centre, this relationship between pulsed sea-breeze intensity and ozone concentration is different, emphasising the importance of the transit time and also the build-up of pollutants in the marine air mass along the route. Finally, the variations of aerosol concentration are also described according to the breeze direction.																	0992-7689						2006	24	11					2809	2822		10.5194/angeo-24-2809-2006								WOS:000243431000005						
J	Coskun, HG; Gulergun, O; Yilmaz, L				Coskun, HG; Gulergun, O; Yilmaz, L			Monitoring of protected bands of Terkos drinking water reservoir of metropolitan Istanbul near the Black Sea coast using satellite data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												In this Study, remote sensing (RS) with computer-based geographic information systems (GIS) techniques are used as a tool for monitoring the water basin area and water quality in Istanbul's relatively less polluted and comparatively less destroyed catchment of the metropolis drinking water dam reservoir named Terkos. It is necessary to work with recent data to be able to identify the effects of urbanization on the water quality of the Terkos dam catchment area that supplies drinking water to the metropolis. RS is an important toot to monitor water quality and urban terrain. For this aim, a project has been initiated at the Technical University Remote Sensing Laboratory, under the Istanbul Water and Sewerage Administration (ISKI) sponsorship in Istanbul. The project uses SPOT-PAN, XS and IRS-1C/D PAN and satellite data of 1993 and 2000 for urban analysis and Landsat-TM and LISS-III satellite data of 1992 and 2000 for water quality. For calibration and validation, ground truth samples are collected from the experimental area. The RS data was converted into the UTM coordinate system and image enhancement and classification techniques are used. Raster data is converted to vector data to assess the study area for analyzing in GTS for the purpose of planning and decision-making on protected water basin zones. As a result of monitoring land use and water quality changes, recommendations are made for planning and management of the protected environment of the Terkos catchment C I protected area. Measuring land use change is a very important issue for controlling the future development of the basin, GIS techniques are performed and results are illustrated in established models on the four protected zones of Terkos water basin.
