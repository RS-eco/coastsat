However, patchy coral cover, varying intensities of bleaching, and water depths are likely to limit the application of remote sensing techniques in monitoring and mapping coral bleaching. Today, satellite multispectral sensors routinely provide images of reefs from 4 m (Ikonos) to 30 m resolution (Landsat); however, the adequacy of these sensors for monitoring and mapping bleaching events remains unclear. To clarify these issues, scanned aerial photographs acquired during the 1998 bleaching event over the Great Barrier Reef (Australia) were analyzed at various spatial resolutions, from 10 cm to 5 in. We found that the accuracy of mapping bleaching is highly sensitive to spatial resolution. Highest accuracy was obtained at 10 cm resolution for detection of totally bleached colonies. At 1 m resolution, as much as 50% of the 10-cm resolution signal is lost, though the spatial patterns remain correctly described. Partially bleached (pale) corals are difficult to detect even in aerial surveys, leading to an underestimation of overall bleaching levels (total and partial bleaching) in aerial photos compared to in-situ surveys. If data volume and,processing time are limiting factors, local variance analysis suggests that the optimal resolution necessary to capture spatial patterns of bleaching is in the range 40-80 cm.																	0722-4028					JUL	2002	21	2					147	154		10.1007/s00338-002-0233-x								WOS:000177495000006						
J	Walter, DJ; Lambert, DN; Young, DC				Walter, DJ; Lambert, DN; Young, DC			Sediment facies determination using acoustic techniques in a shallow-water carbonate environment, Dry Tortugas, Florida	MARINE GEOLOGY												Two high-frequency acoustic seafloor classification systems (12- and 15-kHz) were used in conjunction with sediment core analysis to characterize sediment facies at a study site near Garden Key in Dry Tortugas, Florida. The acoustic system uses echo return amplitude to compute acoustic impedance that is then correlated with sampled sediment impedance values calculated from wet bulk density and compressional wave velocity. Several bottom provinces were identified using the 15-kHz data to construct a real-time map of ship tracks in colors that represent the surficial sediment facies type. Sediment facies over the entire study site (36 km 2) range from sandy silts to exposed limestone rock and coral reef structures. Color contour maps using the 12-kHz data, created after correlating acoustic impedance predictions with core measured sediment properties, validates the initial facies pattern predictions made in real-time. The sediment facies patterns indicate a long-term pattern of deposition of fine-grained, silt-sized, surficial sediments in an area adjacent to the emergent carbonate embankment. Two-dimensional acoustic profiles along survey tracklines also provide cross-sectional views of seafloor and subbottom stratigraphy that confirm the buildup of these fine sediments in the northwest corner of the study site. A generous supply of sediment resulting from an abundance of benthic green algae (Halimeda sp.) on adjacent shallow platforms form a thick sequence of fine sandy silt at the base of the southeastern edge of the embankment and fringing reef. Sediment cover over the limestone bedrock thins and becomes coarse southeast of Garden and Bush Keys, suggesting the likely existence of a dominant flow around the shallow carbonate embankment that restricts export of fine sediments out of the area.

Hyperspectral data can be regarded as continuous and the derivative spectroscopy is effective for extracting coral reef components, including sand, macroalgae, and healthy, bleached, recently dead, and old dead coral. Radiative transfer models are effective for feasibility studies of satellite or airborne remote sensing. Using these techniques, we simulate and analyze the apparent reflectance of coral reef benthic features associated with bleaching events, obtained by hyperspectral sensors on various platforms (ROV, boat, airplane, and satellite), and suggest that the coral reef health on reef fiats can be discriminated precisely.

J	Holden, H				Holden, H			Characterisation of optical water quality in Bunaken National Marine Park, North Sulawesi, Indonesia	SINGAPORE JOURNAL OF TROPICAL GEOGRAPHY												Effective passive optical remote sensing of submerged coral reef ecosystems requires not only appropriate atmospheric correction, but also water column correction. Algorithms accounting for atmospheric effects are fairly well established and readily available, but water column correction algorithms are still under development. Many approaches to water column correction assume horizontal homogeneity and strict adherence to Beer's Law of logarithmic vertical attenuation, which may not be the case in many coral reef ecosystems. Water column optical properties were measured using a multispectral dropsonde radiometer in Bunaken National Marine Park, North Sulawesi, Indonesia, to examine the vertical and horizontal variability of light in a typical coral reef environment. This largely descriptive case study demonstrates the complexity of the interaction of light in shallow coastal environments with often highly reflective substrata and serves to warn against assumptions of water optical property homogeneity. Downwelling attenuation coefficients are provided for use in water column correction of future remote sensing missions.																	0129-7619					MAR	2002	23	1					23	36		10.1111/1467-9493.00116								WOS:000175215700002

One limiting factor., however, is the difficulty in accounting for the variable effects of the water column on the optical reflectance characteristics of submerged features. These variable water column effects have been observed as depth, bottom-type, and wavelength dependent; such complex modifications limit the accuracy of remote identification of submerged coral reef features. In a preliminary attempt to examine the extent of the problem in a complex coral reef ecosystem, in situ hyperspectral reflectance measurements were collected in the U.S. Virgin Islands at various depths over different substrate types in water of consistent optical quality. A comparison is made between hyperspectral reflectance measured at the top and bottom of the water column in different water depths over different substrate types in an effort to alert users of remotely sensed data of the potential problems of identifying submerged features without appropriate corrections. While most coral reef remote sensing projects assume vertical and horizontal homogeneity of water optical properties and consider variation in optical reflectance representative of change in bottom type, this preliminary study reveals that the case is more complex and appreciable effort must be made to correct for the effects of the water column for accurate identification of submerged features.																	0007-4977					SEP	2001	69	2					685	699										WOS:000172609000037						
J	Holden, H; LeDrew, E				Holden, H; LeDrew, E			Hyperspectral discrimination of healthy versus stressed corals using in situ reflectance	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Remote sensing technology has many attributes that would be beneficial to monitoring submerged coral reef ecosystems such as the ability to revisit a site repetitively and consistently. One of the limiting factors, however, is the lack of a quantitative means of discriminating optically similar features such as healthy coral and algae-covered surfaces. We have shown previously that common coral reef features are optically similar to the naked eye, but can be discriminated using hyperspectral technology, thus reducing misclassification. The greatest source of classification error is a result of optical confusion between healthy coral and algae-covered surfaces even when high spectral resolution data is considered. This is an important distinction to make since an unhealthy coral is susceptible to rapid colonization by macroalgae and remote monitoring missions must be able to distinguish between these ecosystem phases. A high spectral resolution in situ library is presented and evaluated for potential use as a classification system for hyperspectral remotely sensed images of coral reef environments.																	0749-0208					FAL	2001	17	4					850	858										WOS:000172520100007

Before 1983, the herbivore D. antillarum was pervasive on coral reefs in the region. Nine months after first detection of the mass mortality, 95% of the urchins had perished, and algal cover of coral increased between 100% and 250%. A water-borne pathogen was hypothesized as the causative agent, but it was never isolated. To date, surface current patterns have been used exclusively to explain both the cause and the distribution patterns of The mortality event. Using archived satellite images, were-examined the water-borne pathogen hypothesis and investigated whether other mechanisms could also account for the dissemination pattern in some areas. In addition, archived satellite images were utilized to detect changes in coral reef reflectance, For infections in the Gulf of Mexico and Bermuda, satellite images confirm that surface currents are likely responsible for the distribution of the pathogen. For infections in the eastern Caribbean (Curacao, U.S. Virgin Islands, Barbados), however, another mechanism, possibly ballast water exchange, must be considered because the surface current and infection patterns do not coincide. Changes in coral reflectance were detectable from Landsat thermatic mapping data before and after the mass mortality and correspond to the change in algal cover. Results from our study demonstrate the Potential of satellite images for use in determining connectivity between regions of the Caribbean and in detecting changes in coral reef cover.																	0888-8892					AUG	2001	15	4					885	891		10.1046/j.1523-1739.2001.015004885.x								WOS:000170179600016						
J	Fuchs, E				Fuchs, E			Separating the fluorescence and reflectance components of coral spectra	APPLIED OPTICS												The optical signal leaving the surface of fluorescing corals is a combination of elastic and inelastic scatter. A new experimental method was developed to separate the fluorescence and the reflectance components that involves measurements with and without a long-pass cutoff filter that eliminates the fluorescence contribution to the signal. The required measurements were performed underwater to demonstrate the applicability of the method for in situ applications. Computations with prototype rather than individually measured fluorescence emission spectra do not significantly compromise the accuracy of the results. A model was developed for calculating the interaction of the reflectance and the fluorescence components with new incident illumination conditions. The model calculations were supported by field experiment. We show that the contribution of fluorescence to some coral's spectra in various illumination conditions justifies consideration in optical models. The results are applicable to modeling the spectra of fluorescing corals under any irradiance spectrum and interpreting remote-sensing data in the relevant wavelength range. Further research is necessary to examine the significance of fluorescence near coral reefs at various scales.

Live coral cover, sea surface temperature (SST) and salinity were monitored during 1997-98, in conjunction with 'hot spot' satellite bleaching predictions of NOAA's NESDIS. Coral reef bleaching during the 1997-98 El Nino at Bahia Banderas coincided closely with satellite bleaching predictions and with experimental observations on coral tolerance to thermal stress. The initial bleaching event rapidly evolved into an unprecedented massive coral mortality (96%), equivalent to the catastrophic coral mortalities observed in the Galapagos Islands during the 1982-83 ENSO. The sudden mass bleaching and mortality of corals at Bahia Banderas was most likely caused by the marked accelerated warming rate (+3.5 degreesC mo(-1)), an order of magnitude higher than that observed during the 1982-83 El Nino in the Galapagos Islands (+0.35 degreesC mo(-1)). Also, the SST anomaly observed during the 1997-98 ENSO at Bahia Banderas (+6.1 degreesC) was 30% higher than in 1982-83 in the Galapagos area (+4.5 degreesC). The recovery of the Bahia a Banderas coral reefs is uncertain since the dead coral substrate has already been covered with filamentous fleshy algae. In contrast to the long-lasting existence of corals and coral reefs in the region, reef frameworks are typically very thin. This situation may indicate the frequent recurrence of mortality events due to environmental extremes, such as ENSO, that have limited reef development in the northeastern tropical Pacific Ocean.

J	Mumby, PJ				Mumby, PJ			Beta and habitat diversity in marine systems: a new approach to measurement, scaling and interpretation	OECOLOGIA												Habitat diversity is a widely used criterion for locating conservation activities such as protected areas. Most habitat diversity indices are measures of alpha diversity at the scale of habitats and are therefore insensitive to the underlying biological differences between habitats. To incorporate such inter-habitat differences, a new method is presented which calculates a measure of beta (beta) diversity from pixels within a window passed throughout a habitat map. To avoid confusion with beta diversity indices, the new measure is called beta -dissimilarity. beta -Dissimiliarity is calculated from the mean Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, D-m, of field data which comprise each habitat class. The variance of D-m distinguishes discrete beta -dissimilarity distributions from homogenous patterns. The method also attempts to remove some of the arbitrary aspects of habitat mapping, can be scaled to other levels of diversity or measures of community structure, is readily interpretable and permits hypothesis testing. Its applications to ecosystem science and coastal management are discussed and illustrated.

J	Andrefouet, S; Payri, C				Andrefouet, S; Payri, C			Scaling-up carbon and carbonate metabolism of coral reefs using in-situ data and remote sensing	CORAL REEFS												Areal up-scaling at reef-scale of organic and inorganic metabolism is possible using in-situ measurements and remote sensing data providing the extent of each bottom type inside the reef. Using a SPOT image and published values of metabolism, the gross production (93,560 x 10(3) kg C year(-1)), excess production (10,017 x 10(3) kg C year(-1)) and calcification (165,348 x 10(3) kg CaCO3 year(-1)) over 35 km(2) of coral reef environment in Moorea Island (French Polynesia) are estimated. While the computations are straightforward, certain assumptions must be made in order to conduct the scaling exercise. The exercise is valid only if the metabolism of reef benthos is additive through increasing spatial scale. Despite the difficulty of quantitatively assessing our extrapolations, spatial additivity seems to represent the reality. The other limitation is that the reef must be considered as a closed system, in an equilibrium state supposedly accurately described by the few available in-situ measurements. To consider the reef an open system, long-term metabolic measurements coupled with knowledge of oceanic and land forcing processes are required. These theoretical considerations point to the necessity of integrated multi-scale studies based on both remote sensing and in-situ data in order to better understand the productivity and calcification of reefs in the current global change context.

OCEANOLOGICA ACTA												In the framework of a comprehensive study of the coastal marine ecosystems of Guadeloupe Island (French West Indies), a remote sensing survey of marine communities was conducted in the Bay of the Grand Cul-de-Sac Marin. Pictures of SPOT satellite were used. At first sight, XS data from SPOT did not seem to be well adapted to extract information from deepest underwater areas. In the present study, a method for analysis of XS data was developed, which increases tenuous spectral differences associated to very low intensity signals. This technique led to a better distinction of objects, even the deepest ones. Reference surfaces were then identified in the field and a reliable supervised classification was conducted, which reflected the high diversity of ecological themes (up to 32) of the area to 20 m depth. A total of 23 700 ha of biota was clearly identified. Mangrove covered up to 2 700 ha. Submerged areas were constituted of 15 700 ha of soft bottoms and 3 800 ha of hard substrate bottoms. On the coral reefs, flourishing coral communities accounted only for 113 ha (11.2%). This result enhances the alarming situation of these communities in Guadeloupe. Finally, seagrass beds took up to 8 200 ha (i.e. 42% of the total sublittoral area, 58% of soft bottom substrates). This ecosystem revealed to be of primary importance within the studied area and particular attention was paid to seagrass beds of Thalassia rest testudinum. Twelve themes were retained to describe them, based on the coverage rate of the substratum by the plants and the type of the sediment colonised. The final document expresses well the high complexity of the studied area. This map constitutes a reference of the present status of the coastal benthic communities of the 'Grand Cul-de-Sac Marin' and can be useful for scientists and the administrative managers of that area.

Actual measured reflectance spectra from field work are used as input data. Four coral species are considered, to survey the natural range of coral reflectance: Montastrea cavernosa, Acropora palmata, Dichocoenia stokesii, and Siderastrea siderea. Four noncoral objects associated with reefs are also considered: sand, coralline algae, green macroalgae, and algal turf. The reflectance spectra as would be measured at the top of the atmosphere are substantially different from the in situ spectra, due to differential attenuation by the water column and, most importantly, by atmospheric Rayleigh scattering. The result is that many of the spectral features that can be used to distinguish coral species from their surroundings or from one another, which have been used successfully with surface or aircraft data, would be obscured in spectral measurements from a spacecraft. However, above the atmosphere, the radiance contrasts between most coral species and most brighter noncoral objects remain noticeable for water column depths up to 20 m. Over many spectral intervals, the reflectance from dark coral under shallow water is smaller than that of deep water. The maximum top-of-atmosphere radiances, and maximum contrasts between scene types, occur between 400 nm and 600 nm. This study supports the conclusions of recent satellite reef mapping exercises, suggesting that coral reef identification should be feasible using satellite remote sensing, but that detailed reef mapping (e.g., species identification) may be more difficult.

Thus, by the time remotely sensed imagery has been acquired, discrimination of live and dead corals is no longer facile. Field measurements of spectral reflectance of live and algal-colonised dead corals (arising from different mortality events) were made in French Polynesia.

Fishing on reefs can be classified into three stages: manageable, ecosystem-overfished, and Malthusian-overfished. Fishing with blasting devices and poisons is often associated with the third stage. Reductions in herbivory caused by overfishing may enhance the likelihood of organic pollution causing a coral-algal phase shift following major disturbances. However, cage studies indicate that reduction in herbivory can lead to the proliferation of algae even in the absence of eutrophication. A major concern with the widespread coral bleaching associated with the 1997-1998 El Nino event is the likelihood that reefs already stressed by overfishing and organic pollution may not return to coral dominance after severe bleaching. Clues Co levels of fishing and to the potential to recover from disturbances include changes in the de-vegetated "haloes" around coral stands on reef flats and the differing spectral signatures of live coral, recently dead coral, and coral covered with red encrusting, green filamentous, or brown frondose algae. These clues may facilitate broad area assessments of shallow reef areas via aircraft, space shuttles, or satellites.

J	Coops, N; Culvenor, D				Coops, N; Culvenor, D			Utilizing local variance of simulated high spatial resolution imagery to predict spatial pattern of forest stands	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Spatial pattern defined as the distribution of individuals in space, is an important characteristic of forest stands. It provides an insight into the allocation of above-and below-ground resources to a tree, as well as reflecting,a the stand history, microclimate, and competition between different species over time. The spatial arrangement of trees carl be described as random, aggregated, or regular with a number of statistics existing that characterize the spatial pattern of a given tree population. High spatial resolution remote sensing is an obvious tool to facilitate the measuring and monitoring of spatial patterns in forest stands. Remote sensing imagery provides detailed information about forest structure while still allowing large areas of forest to be mapped and monitored. The increased availability of high resolution imagery coupled with improvements in scene processing and interpretation techniques allow additional information, such as texture, to be extracted from this type of imagery. In this paper the spatial pattern of trees within a forest stand is related to high spatial resolution imagery. This relationship is developed using a technique that relates scene texture variance to a statistic describing spatial pattern. The technique was tested on a number of simulated remote sensing scenes by systematically varying the size and spatial distribution of trees using a geometric-optical model. Results indicate that it is theoretically possible to derive the spatial pattern of trees within a high spatial resolution forested scene provided crown size is estimated a priori. It is also likely that the coral projected foliage cover of the canopy will affect the ability to predict spatial distribution based on texture variance. It was concluded that the spatial pattern of trees within a scene can play a vital role in the amount and degree of variation existing within imagery. It is important to consider the implications of these type of relationships when developing variance-based models of forest structure. (C) Published by Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.

J	Holden, H; Ledrew, E				Holden, H; Ledrew, E			Hyperspectral identification of coral reef features	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Remote sensing is regarded as an efficient and accurate tool for mapping and monitoring changes in coral reef extent and: well being consistently over large geographic areas. However, several operational restrictions limit the accuracy with which coral reefs can be monitored remotely. A primary restriction is that the spectral responses of numerous features in the coral reef environment are optically similar, which has the potential of contributing to misclassification errors. In 1996, in situ spectral reflectance data were collected in Fiji using an underwater cosine receptor and a 10 m underwater fibre optic cable, which permitted sampling at depth while scuba diving. In 1997, in situ spectral reflectance measurements of exposed coral reef features with little or no water cover were collected in Indonesia using the same radiometer, but a nonwaterproof remote cosine receptor. These spectral datasets were compared and analysed to test the following hypotheses. First, geographic location does not affect the spectral reflectance characteristics; second, the morphology of reef features does affect the spectral reflectance characteristics; third, bleached coral and healthy coral have distinct spectral reflectance characteristics; and finally, a spectral reflectance index will aid image classification. Results indicate that the spectra measured in Fiji and those measured in Indonesia are statistically similar, so all spectra were merged into one large spectral dataset and principal components analysis was used to determine the most representative spectra. Derivative spectroscopy was then used to conclude that spectral discrimination is indeed possible between 654 and 674 nm, between 582 and 686 nm and between 506 and 566 nm. The proportion of correctly identified spectra using the three-step procedure of first derivatives is 75% with the main source of error resulting from spectral variability of algae reflectance. The results of this feasibility study indicate that hyperspectral remote sensing of a coral reef environment will lead to accurate identification and subsequent monitoring of changes in coral health and overall well being.																	0143-1161					SEP 10	1999	20	13					2545	2563		10.1080/014311699211921								WOS:000082243800006

Thirty-one river catchments drain directly into the waters of the Great Barrier Reef; NE Australia. This case study was undertaken on the floodplain of the Herbert River catchment in north Queensland, utilizing remote sensing and GIS to assess both spatial and temporal changes in freshwater wetlands and riparian forests. We demonstrate that there has been a very large reduction in the area of these ecosystems since European settlement in the mid nineteenth century, with an 80% decline in their extent since 1943. We provide a range of quantitative measures to show that the landscape diversity of these ecosystems has also declined. These changes are of importance in terms of regional, national and international trends. We argue that policy, planning and management reform is required if the remaining ecological, economic and social values of these systems and the adjacent Great Barrier Reef Marine Park are to be maintained.																	0376-8929					SEP	1999	26	3					229	235		10.1017/S0376892999000314								WOS:000083565600011						
J	Myers, MR; Hardy, JT; Mazel, CH; Dustan, P				Myers, MR; Hardy, JT; Mazel, CH; Dustan, P			Optical spectra and pigmentation of Caribbean reef corals and macroalgae	CORAL REEFS												Coastal reef degradation and widespread bleaching of corals, i.e. loss of pigments and/or symbiotic zooxanthellae, is increasing globally. Remote sensing from boats, aircraft or satellites has great potential for assessing the extent of reef change, but will require ground-verified spectral algorithms characteristic of healthy and degraded reef populations. We collected seven species of Caribbean reef corals and also representative macroalgae from reefs near Lee Stocking Island, Bahamas and quantified their pigments using high performance liquid chromatography. We also measured the fluorescence and reflectance spectra of corals and macroalgae using an in situ benthic spectrofluorometer. In visibly pigmented (unbleached) coral from 4 to 5 m depth, the mean (+/- SD) surface density of pigments (3.0 +/- 1.3 mu g chlorophyll-a cm(-2) and 2.1 +/- 0.7 mu g peridinin cm(-2)) was similar between colonies of the same species, but differed among species. The mean quantity of pigment per zooxanthella(1.8 +/- 0.9 pg chi-a cell(-1) and 1.4 +/- 0.7 pg peridinin cell(-1)) also differed among species and sometimes between colonies of the same species. Chi-a and peridinin densities per surface area of coral were positively correlated. When excited with blue light (480 nm), macroalgae and corals had typical chlorophyll fluorescence with a peak at 680 nm and a smaller shoulder peak at 730 to 740 nm. Most corals, unlike macroalgae, also had distinct fluorescence peaks between 500 and 530 nm. In visibly bleached corals 680 nm fluorescence was greatly reduced in amplitude. Pigmented coral, under natural lighting conditions, had a reflected light peak at about 570 nm. Reflectance increased over all wavelengths in bleached corals, with the greatest increase at the wavelengths where chlorophyll and accessory pigments absorb light, i.e. 670 and 450 to 550 nm. Both fluorescence and reflectance spectra appear promising to remotely differentiate between pigmented and bleached coral and between coral and macroalgae.																	0722-4028					JUL	1999	18	2					179	186		10.1007/s003380050177								WOS:000081850000015						
J	Mumby, PJ; Harborne, AR				Mumby, PJ; Harborne, AR			Development of a systematic classification scheme of marine habitats to facilitate regional management and mapping of Caribbean coral reefs	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Most coastal habitat mapping is conducted on an ad hoc basis with little consistency in terminology and ambiguous documentation. These limitations obstruct interpretation and integration of maps for coral reef science and management, particularly at regional (international) scales where standardisation is urgently required. This paper advocates an objective, systematic approach to habitat classification which couples coastal geomorphology and benthic cover. Benthic classes are derived and described objectively using agglomerative hierarchical classification of field data and Similarity Percentage analysis of resulting clusters. The scheme has a hierarchical structure to accommodate various user requirements, variable availability of data, and the spatial scales of most remote sensing methods. We illustrate our approach with a scheme based on extensive field data from the Turks and Caicos Islands and Belize. While the scheme will not represent all habitats of the Caribbean, it provides a useful basis for a regional classification and illustrates the systematic approach. Standardised regional maps of coastal habitats will help development of predictive models of coral metapopulation dynamics, aid the identification of larval source and sink areas, and facilitate strategic transboundary planning of protected areas to maximise species, habitat, and ecosystem conservation. Habitats might also be interpreted to reflect ecosystem processes such as productivity and trophic guild structure, thereby allowing the ecosystem function to be examined at larger scales.

J	Mumby, PJ; Green, EP; Edwards, AJ; Clark, CD				Mumby, PJ; Green, EP; Edwards, AJ; Clark, CD			The cost-effectiveness of remote sensing for tropical coastal resources assessment and management	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Although coastal habitat mapping is expensive, remote sensing is a more cost-effective technique than alternative field-survey methods (where effectiveness is defined as overall map accuracy), Satellite imagery is suitable for coarse detail habitat mapping where overall accuracies of c. 70% can be achieved but is inadequate for fine detail mapping, achieving c. 40% accuracy. Four types of cost are encountered when undertaking remote sensing: (1) set-up costs, (2) field survey costs, (3) image acquisition costs and (4) the time spent on analysis of field data and processing imagery. The largest of these are set-up costs such as the acquisition of hardware and software which may comprise 48-78% of the total cost of the project depending on specific objectives. For coarse-detail habitat mapping with satellite imagery, the second highest cost is field survey which can account for c. 20% of total costs and >80% of total costs if a remote sensing facility already exists. Field survey is a vital component of any habitat mapping programme and may constitute c. 70% of project duration. For mapping small coastal areas (<60 km in any direction) in coarse detail, SPOT XS is the most cost-effective satellite sensor but for larger areas Landsat TM is the most cost-effective and accurate sensor: Detailed habitat mapping should be undertaken using digital airborne scanners or interpretation of colour aerial photography (API). The cost of commissioning the acquisition of such imagery can be high [pound 15000-pound 27000 (US$24000-$43000) even for small areas of 150 km(2)] and may constitute 27-40% of total costs (64-75% if set-up costs are excluded). Acquisition of digital airborne imagery is more expensive than the acquisition of colour aerial photography but is offset against the huge investment in time required to create maps from API. If habitat maps are needed urgently, API may be prohibitively time-consuming. For small areas of say 150 km2, a map could be created within 25 days using CASI but might take six times longer to create using API. We estimate that API is only cheaper if the staff costs for API are considerably less than pound 80 day(-1). As the scope of the survey increases in size, the cost of API is likely to rise much faster than that arising from digital airborne scanners. If the costs of API and digital airborne scanners are similar; the latter instruments should be favoured because they are likely to yield more accurate results than API. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

J	Mumby, PJ				Mumby, PJ			Can Caribbean coral populations be modelled at metapopulation scales?	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Understanding and predicting the connectivity of coral reef organisms linked by larval dispersal is a key goal of tropical coastal ecosystem science! and management. As oceanographers make advances modelling transport processes between reefs, ecologists should be prepared to embrace the population dynamics of organisms at larger metapopulation scales. A metapopulation is demographically closed but contains multiple open local populations. Metapopulation models of coral dynamics would aid the identification of larval source and sink areas and help identify the boundaries of demographically closed populations. Metapopulation models would also aid the understanding of species extinctions and help formulate transboundary management strategies to conserve ecosystem function. Existing metapopulation models are not spatially realistic or proven to represent physical and biological processes at appropriate spatial and temporal scales. Before more realistic alternatives can be established, further research is needed into (1) the larval transport between reefs (i.e. the coupling of reef-scale and oceanic models of water circulation, the pre settlement mortality rates of larvae, and larval mobility in the water column), (2) the influence of larval supply on coral population dynamics at local (10s of kilometres) scales (i.e. processes of settlement behaviour, post-settlement mortality, and the pre-emption of space by algae), cmd (3) processes affecting the net fecundity of local populations (i.e. interactions of colony size, partial mortality rate, competition with algae, and the influence of habitat, physical disturbance, herbivore pressure, nutrification and sedimentation).

J	Chauvaud, S; Bouchon, C; Maniere, R				Chauvaud, S; Bouchon, C; Maniere, R			Remote sensing techniques adapted to high resolution mapping of tropical coastal marine ecosystems (coral reefs, seagrass beds and mangrove)	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The need for high resolution maps in the management of tropical environments is increasing and emphasized by the rapid anthropogenic development often occurring in coastal zones. In areas subject to humid tropical climate, such as the West Indies, cloud coverage often disturbs image acquisition by orbital imagery. Moreover, as these tropical coastal ecosystems, i.e., coral reefs, mangroves and seagrass beds, are intricate and geographically complex, high resolution data must be used to accurately restore these features. Digitized aerial photographs meet these requirements by providing higher-resolution images than orbital remote sensing devices. This paper reports on the method applied to map coral reefs, mangroves and seagrass beds in the Bay of Robert in Martinique Island (French West Indies) by digitizing true-colour aerial photographs. But, as these photographs present two drawbacks, i.e., they are not geographically oriented and their margins are distorted, a reference map was used to design a rectification model. Aerial photographs were first subjected to true-colour digitization. After separation of the red, green and blue bands, an unsupervised classification was achieved, then various masks each corresponding to a given range of depths were built and applied to the initial image. The new images obtained were analysed. Great care was taken in the selection of training sites to gather the pixels characterized by a high spectral similarity which corresponded to precise themes. After ground identification, these training sites enabled a supervized classification to be established, then a confusion matrix was built. The final map consisted of 31 themes. Each theme was related to a particular feature of the benthic communities. The error matrix and subsequent field samplings confirmed the reliability of the final map. In addition to their use in ecosystem studies, e.g., calculation of surface areas; biocoenosis distribution, etc., these thematic maps are of overriding importance for the management of coastal areas.																	0143-1161					DEC	1998	19	18					3625	3639		10.1080/014311698213858								WOS:000077774800010						
J	McGrath, TA; Smith, GW				McGrath, TA; Smith, GW			The effects of the 1995/1996 Western Atlantic coral bleaching event on the patch reefs around San Salvador Island, Bahamas	REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL												In October 1995, a mass bleaching event was reported in the Western Atlantic, including areas such as Belize, where little bleaching damage had been recorded previously. Reports based on remote sensing data suggested that sea temperatures in the region were warmer than normal during early October. In November, a monitoring team found that bleaching was well above background levels on the patch reefs around San Salvador Island, Bahamas, a location well out of the main influences of the wider Caribbean. These San Salvador patch reefs have been studied in a long-term monitoring project since 1991. The team found that the overall bleaching level in November was 14% of all coral colonies counted on the three monitored reefs. Bleaching affected the various coral species differently. Agaricia sp. were the most affected, as measured both by the number of colonies affected and by the total coral surface area bleached; however, Agaracia was not the most abundant species on any of the sampled reefs. Of those corals colonies affected, the percent of surface area bleached differed from reef to reef. On Lindsay's Reef, an average of 42.2% of the surface area of the bleached corals was affected, while at Rice Bay, the average was 31.3%, and at French Bay, the average was 15.2%. Sea temperatures taken at each reef during the census were normal for this time period. Seven corals were marked and photographed at Lindsay's Reef for future analysis. In addition, samples of the surface mucopolysaccharide layer (SML) from bleached and non-bleached Agaricia sp. were taken for microbiological analysis. The survey and microbiological sampling were repeated in February. One of the marked coral colonies had 100% of its surface bleached in November; by February, it was well on the way to complete recovery. Metabolic comparisons of bacteria from the SMLs showed that the normal microbiota, which had changed during bleaching, returned to a normal distribution in recovery. The February 1996 census showed that bleaching patterns had remained the same, but that the extent and severity of the bleaching had returned to background levels. Sea temperatures at this time were almost 1 degrees C below normal for the time period. By July of 1996, most corals affected by the bleaching event had recovered, with the number damaged or dead representing <1% of the total hard coral cover on these reefs. While the extent of this bleaching event was significant, the long-term impact was negligible.																	0034-7744					DEC	1998	46			5			91	99										WOS:000078824000010

There exists no objective measure of coral health, so that individual perceptions of the paleness of an individual comb head or an entire coral reef, a-e the foundation of coral bleaching reports. It is uncle-stood that coral blenching results from an expulsion or reduction of the algae housed in the individual polyp, which causes the cor-nl to lose its color. Satellite or airborne remote sensing may be a feasible means of mapping and monitoring cor-al reefs over large geographic areas if a quantitative ?means of remotely determining coral health can be developed. In an effort to remotely detect co ml stress, in.situ spectral rflectance of healthy and bleached Fijian scleractinian combs was measured with a handheld spectroradiometer. Principal components and cluster analysis revealed that there is a spectral distinction between healthy and bleached cor-al based largely on magnitude of reflectance. Spectral derivative analysis was used to determine the specific wavelength regions ideal for remote identification of substrate type. These results are encouraging with respect to using an airborne spectroradiometer to identify areas of bleached corals thus enabling accurate monitoring. over time.

J	Holden, H; LeDrew, E				Holden, H; LeDrew, E			The scientific issues surrounding remote detection of submerged coral ecosystems	PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												According to the 1993 colloquium on the 'Global status of coral reefs', our understanding of the global role of coral reefs is inadequate. To increase our understanding, an accurate large-scale mapping and monitoring programme is necessary. Historically, coastal zones have been mapped using traditional surveying tools such as topographic maps, nautical charts, existing aerial photographs and direct observations. Although less expensive than digital imagery, exclusive use of these traditional tools may not be practical for monitoring large or remote coral reef ecosystems accurately. Researchers are attempting to develop an adequate coral reef mapping system based on digital remote sensing, but are impeded by issues such as effects of the intervening Mater column and spectral distinction of bottom types. The two variables discussed, which will contribute to our understanding of the global role of coral reefs, are: I) remote sensing of submerged coral reefs in general; and 2) remote sensing of coral bleaching in particular. A summary of radiative transfer theory is presented and case studies of attempts at mapping remotely the geographic extent and health of submerged ecosystems as well as a discussion of the remote estimation of water depth and quality. Problems in the translation and delivery of information to the end user are presented, and possible solutions suggested.																	0309-1333					JUN	1998	22	2					190	221		10.1191/030913398668695699								WOS:000074866600003

Here we present an account of one of the first coral reef applications. The CASI was flown over reefs of the Turks and Caicos Islands (British West Indies) and set to view 1 m pixels in 8 spectral bands. In addition, reef habitats were sampled in situ by visual assessment of percent cover in 1 m quadrats. Seagrass standing crop was assessed using a calibrated visual scale. Benthic habitats were classified using hierarchical cluster and similarity percentage analyses of the field survey data. Two levels of habitat discrimination were assessed: a coarse level (corals, algae, sand, seagrass) and a fine level which included nine reef habitats. Overall accuracies of CASI-derived habitat maps were 89% and 81% for coarse and fine levels of habitat discrimination, respectively. Accuracies were greatest once CASI data had been processed to compensate for variations in depth and edited to take account of generic patterns of reef distribution. These overall accuracies were significantly (P < 0.001) better than those obtained from satellite imagery of the same site (Landsat MSS, Landsat TM, SPOT XS, SPOT Pan, merged Landsat TM/SPOT Pan). Results from CASI were also significantly better than those from interpretation of 1:10 000 colour aerial photographs of reefs in Anguilla (Sheppard et al. 1995). However, the studies may not have been entirely com parable due to a disparity in the areas mapped.

It has been recently threatened by numerous anthropogenic activities, including oil spills from tankers passing through the Gulf of Suez. The objective of this paper is to carry out an environmental sensitivity analysis of this coastal environment, and to derive an environmental sensitivity index map of the area. Integration of remote sensing and GIS techniques has proved a powerful tool for analyses of the environmental sensitivity for potential oil spills. In this work, SPOT-XS images were used to derive information about various resources of the area, especially the shallow submarine coral reef communities. Topographic and field sur?rey data were combined to produce the required sensitivity map. Ten major natural classes, along the shoreline and foreshore resources and habitats, were identified and analyzed. Their environmental sensitivity to potential oil spill were rated from low to high. The lowest sensitivity was assigned to the sea cliff and the highest to shallow coral reefs. Using GIS functions and analyses, it was possible to produce land use/land cover; shoreline sensitivity; foreshore sensitivity and critical natural resources maps. This information was used to determine protection priority, to propose access and protection planing, and to derive an environmental sensitivity index map of Ras-Mohammed.																	0749-0208					SPR	1998	14	2					502	511										WOS:000073189300012

MARINE BIOLOGY												The capability of satellite and airborne remote-sensing methods for mapping Caribbean coral reefs is evaluated. Reef habitats were categorised into coarse, intermediate and fine detail, using hierarchical classification of field data (percent cover in 1 m quadrats and seagrass standing-crop). Habitats were defined as assemblages of benthic macro-organisms and substrata and were mapped using the satellite sensors Landsat MSS, Landsat TM, SPOT XS, SPOT Pan and merged Landsat TM/SPOT Pan. Habitats were also mapped using the high-resolution digital airborne sensor, CASI (compact airborne spectrographic imager). To map areas >60 km in any direction with coarse detail, Landsat TM was the most accurate and cost-effective satellite sensor (SPOT XS when < 60 km). For maps with intermediate habitat detail, aerial photography (from a comparable study in Anguilla) exhibited similar accuracy to Landsat TM, SPOT XS, SPOT Pan and merged Landsat TM/SPOT Pan. Landsat MSS was consistently the least accurate sensor. Maps from CASI were significantly (p < 0.001) more accurate than satellite sensors and aerial photographs. Maps with detailed habitat information (i.e. >9 reef classes) had a maximum accuracy of 37% when based on satellite imagery, but aerial photography and CASI achieved accuracies of 67 and 81%, respectively. Commissioning of new aerial photography does not appear to be a cost-effective option; satellites are cheaper for coarse habitat-mapping, and detailed habitat-mapping can be conducted more accurately and cheaply with CASI. The results will guide practitioners in matching survey objectives to appropriate remote-sensing methods.

The instrument, designated the benthic spectrofluorometer (BSF), is built around a single-board spectrometer with a 1024-element CCD array. Light input to the spectrometer is via a fiber optic cable, In fluorescence mode, the unit provides manual user-selectable excitation wavelength and measures fluorescence emission over the full visible spectrum. The BSF can also measure the spectrum of downwelling ambient light or of light reflected from surfaces of interest, enabling calculation of spectral reflectance.

Preliminary results indicate that the spectral response of corals can be determined up to a depth of 10 m. An accurate and replicable procedure is proposed to quantify the spectral response of various corals and other submerged substrates to determine biodiversity and stress indicators for mapping and assessing coral ecosystems at site-specific and regional locations.

J	Wellington, GM; Dunbar, RB; Merlen, G				Wellington, GM; Dunbar, RB; Merlen, G			Calibration of stable oxygen isotope signatures in Galapagos corals	PALEOCEANOGRAPHY												A 2-year (1993-1994) study was conducted in the Galapagos Islands (Ecuador) to determine the relationship between delta(18)O in skeletal carbonate and sea surface temperature (SST) in three species of reef-building corals: Pavona clavus, Pavona gigantea, and Porites lobata. Coral samples were grown at 3, 10, and 3 m depth at Bartolome Island, Champion iIsland, and Urvina Bay (Isabela Island), respectively. Hourly measurements of SST and sea surface salinity (SSS) were taken at each site immediately adjacent to colonies which were stained biannually to establish the chronology of growth. In addition, surface waters were sampled periodically (bimonthly to monthly) at each site to determine variation in delta(18)O seawater. Results indicate the mean annual SSTs were similar between sites, varying from 22.9 degrees C at Champion to 23.8 degrees C at Urvina Bay. Comparisons of monthly SST averages between instrumental and remote sensing(satellite, 1 degrees x 1 degrees grid) data show a high correspondence (r(2) ranging from 0.84 to 0.94), indicating that remote sensing data are useful for interpreting the delta(18)O record in corals when instrumental data are lacking. Here delta(18)O(coral) analyses of eight specimens show that coralline aragonite is a reliable indicator of SST in Galapagos. In general, higher-resolution coral sampling/year resolved more of the monthly variation in SST, up to 97% at a sampling resolution of 1.4 samples per millimeter of linear skeletal growth. Comparisions of the delta(18)O(coral) signal among and between species at the same site showed consistent seasonal patterns of variation closely tracking SST. In addition, comparisons between sites were highly concordant, with some differences reflecting local variation in SST. Seasonal patterns, however, were essentially the same over the entire region. Thus we conclude that the delta(18)O(coral) signal from coral skeletons in Galapagos can be used to interpret regional changes in SST variation.																	0883-8305	1944-9186				AUG	1996	11	4					467	480		10.1029/96PA01023								WOS:A1996VM33000008

This area is threatened by numerous anthropogenic activities. The most important risk is that associated with possible oil spills from tankers crossing the Suez canal. The main objective of this study is to prepare an oil spill contingency plan for the study area. SPOT-XS data were used to derive valuable information about the different resources of the area, especially the shallow coral reef communities. SPOT images, ground surveys and GIS analysis have enabled an accurate evaluation of environmental sensitivity. This helped to put forward a proposal of an oil spill contingency plan, in order to protect environmentally sensitive areas such as Ras-Mohammed.																	0143-1161					JUL 20	1996	17	11					2013	2026		10.1080/01431169608948756								WOS:A1996UW88500004

These additional information will certainly form vital remote-sensing-based input for preparing coastal zone management plans.																	0011-3891					APR 10	1996	70	7					614	618										WOS:A1996UG64500027

Spectral and wide-band values (SPOT-XS-1 and XS-2 and Landsat TM-1) of the diffuse attenuation coefficient were computed from in situ spectral irradiances measured with an underwater spectroradiometer in the ocean and in the lagoonal waters of two islands in French Polynesia. These data show that emerged zones may strongly influence attenuation, mainly at short wavelengths. Attenuation was also assessed statistically in two different ways from a SPOT image of the island of Bora Bora. This image was then processed to obtain a map of the bottom corrected for water column effects.

These applications ave discussed in the context of specific management objectives and sensors used. Remote sensing remains the only way to obtain synoptic data for large coastal areas uniformly in time and space, repeatedly and nonintrusively. Routine applications to tropical coastal management include the mapping of littoral and shallow marine habitats, change detection, bathymetry mapping, and the study of suspended sediment plumes and coastal currents. The case studies reviewed suggest that wider use of remote sensing in tropical coastal zone management is limited by (1) factors that affect data availability, such as cloud cover and sensor specification; and (2) the problems that decision makers face in selecting a remote sensing technique suitable to their project objectives. These problems arise from the difficulty in comparing the capabilities of different sensors and the limited amount of published information available on practical considerations, such as cost-effectiveness and accuracy assessments. The latter are essential if management decisions are to be based upon the results.

J	MILLER, RL; CRUISE, JF				MILLER, RL; CRUISE, JF			EFFECTS OF SUSPENDED SEDIMENTS ON CORAL GROWTH - EVIDENCE FROM REMOTE-SENSING AND HYDROLOGIC MODELING	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Remotely sensed images derived from several sources were combined with in situ samples to estimate suspended sediments discharged from three rivers into Mayaguez Bay, Puerto Rico. Multispectral data were acquired using the Calibrated Airborne Multispectral Scanner (CAMS) and the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM). CAMS data were used to produce spatial maps of suspended sediment concentrations in Mayaguez Bay during low to moderate discharge for 1990-1992. Images of band cover/land use during 1975 and 1985 were generated from a supervised density slicing technique applied to a mosaicked image of digitized aerial photos and from an unsupervised classification of the TM image. A geomorphic hydrologic model was used to simulate runoff and sediment yield from the drainage basin of the Guanajibo river; because land cover within the basin did not change significantly during 1975-1985, the hydrologic model provided estimates of sediment discharged by the Guanajibo river into the bay during this time period. Growth rates of the coral Montastrea annularis of Rodiguez reef were obtained from a previous study. Annual growth rates as determined from coral banding decreased significantly (r = 0.69) with increased sediment loading to the bay (tons/year). Evidence from remote sensing and hydrologic modeling suggests that sediment reaches the reef only during episodic, high-discharge events. During low to moderate discharge, sediments, both suspended within the river plume and resuspended sediments, are restricted to the near-shore regions by the prevailing circulation. Hence, a direct relationship between river runoff and coral growth rates was established in this study.				kohki, sowa/D-2955-2011													0034-4257					SEP	1995	53	3					177	187		10.1016/0034-4257(95)00081-B								WOS:A1995RV89600006

This article describes the importance of GIS in assisting institutional cooperation and illustrates the many advantages of GIS over conventional approaches to mapping and data management. GIS is a powerful analytical tool that has allowed the improvement of inadequate ground control and base mapping through the incorporation of differential global positioning systems technology. Subsequent resource mapping has been carried out through the application of SPOT Panchromatic and other remotely sensed imagery, field survey, and existing GIS data. In Belize, GIS products are increasingly being used as the primary source for management plans. The technology will play a key role in the future development of management initiatives for the country's coastal zone.

J	MAZEL, CH				MAZEL, CH			SPECTRAL MEASUREMENTS OF FLUORESCENCE EMISSION IN CARIBBEAN CNIDARIANS	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Fluorescence effects in cnidarian host tissues have been investigated only sporadically and have largely been described qualitatively. In past studies specimens were selected for investigation based on their apparent fluorescence under either daylight or ultraviolet (W-A or UV-B) illumination, thereby missing relationships between the 2 effects. In this study samples of a Variety of Caribbean cnidarian species were selected based on their in situ responses to daylight and/or UV-A illumination. Fluorescence emission spectra (excitation wavelength 365 or 405 nm) were measured for sources in the host tissues. A sorting of specimens by similarity in spectral shape resulted in groupings containing members of different species. Emission spectra measured from separate specimens of a single species exhibited clear differences in some cases. There was no correlation between the spectral shape and the relative fluorescence intensity observed under illumination by ultraviolet light (UV-A, emission maximum approximate to 360 nm). Emission maxima fell in the range of 480 to 590 nm. The only source of fluorescence at wavelengths greater than 650 nm was chlorophyll in zooxanthellae. Some specimens contained material with an emission spectrum identical to that of phycoerythrin (peak wavelength approximate to 575 nm). The results are of interest for studies of photoecology and for applications of coral reef optical remote sensing.																	0171-8630					APR	1995	120	1-3					185	191		10.3354/meps120185								WOS:A1995QY53700018

CORAL provides the user with several noteworthy features: 1) a consistent, robust, and intuitive graphical user interface to a geophysical database(s) and related analysis and display functions that are user extensible; 2) a high-level database interface for acquiring any desired subset(s) of data from multiple databases, 3) a simplified method for manipulating subsets of data once retrieved from one or more databases and 4) analysis functions organized as extensible libraries for use in a wide variety of geophysical problems. Moreover, the library structure allows other analysis capabilities (e.g., Statistical Sciences' S-PLUS) to be added easily to CORAL. CORAL also provides graphical and rendering capabilities and support for several map projections commonly used in earth sciences. Because CORAL functions can be designed to support either regularly or irregularly gridded data, CORAL can be used for calibrating satellite data with ground-truth data, as a compute engine for joint remote sensing-in situ data analysis, and for assembling and analyzing specific subsets of data from large archived in situ databases. Because the X Windows Applications Programmer Interface was used in its design, CORAL can be run on a variety of hardware platforms. Moreover, because CORAL's distributed database management system (Empress) supports heterogeneous networks. CORAL provides a way for several scientists working on a given project to share their data and analyzed results (the Internet).																	0739-0572					DEC	1994	11	6					1638	1655		10.1175/1520-0426(1994)011<1638:TCORAA>2.0.CO;2								WOS:A1994QA65800014

These formulae also involve two apparent optical properties of the water body: a mean diffuse attenuation coefficient and a hypothetical reflectance which would be observed if the bottom was infinitely deep. The validity of these approximate formulae was tested by comparing their outputs with accurate solutions of the radiative transfer obtained under the same boundary conditions by Monte Carlo simulations. These approximations were also checked by comparing the reflectance spectra for varying bottom depths and compositions determined in coastal lagoons with those predicted by the formulae. These predictions were based on separate determinations of the spectral albedos of typical materials covering the floor, such as coral sand and various green or brown algae. The simple analytical expressions are accurate enough for most practical applications and also allow quantitative discussion of the limitations of remote-sensing techniques for bottom recognition and bathymetry.

However, bleached reefs alone are poor indicators because they reflect the final stages of stress. This research project used multidate satellite imagery to look for coral reef changes as indicators of stress. Findings suggest that (1) satellite imagery can be used to identify small-scale changes in coastal marine ecosystems, including coral reefs; (2) remote sensing, marine ecology, and ethnographic data can be integrated to suggest potential causes of coral reef stress; and (3) changes in reef, seagrass, and mangrove ecozones are more closely tied to fishing, tourism, and land use practices than to global warming.																	0300-7839					SEP	1994	22	3					355	378		10.1007/BF02168857								WOS:A1994PZ90400006

False color composites generated from Landsat Thematic Mapper and SPOT image data, digital elevation models derived from stereophotogrammetric analysis of SPOT data, and field observations document that a approximately 10-km-wide swath inland from the coast is covered in many places with coalescing alluvial fans of Quaternary age. Wadis cutting through the fans exhibit several pairs of fluvial terraces, and wadi walls expose alluvium interbedded with coralline limestone deposits. three distinct coral terrace are evident along the coastline. Climatic, eustatic, and tectonic uplift controls on the overall system were simulated using a cellular automata algorithm with die following characteristics: (1) uplift as a function of position and time, as defined by the elevations and ages of corals; (2) climatic variations driven by insolation changes associated with Milankovitch cycles; (3) sea level fluctuations based on U/rh ages of coral terraces and eustatic data; and (4) parameterized fluvial erosion and deposition. Results imply that the fans and coralline limestones were generated in a setting in which the tectonic uplift rate decreased over the Quaternary to negligible values at present. Coralline limestones formed during eustatic highstands when alluvium was trapped upstream and wadis filled with debris. During lowstands, wadis cut into sedimentary deposits; coupled with continuing uplift, fans were dissected, leaving remnant surfaces, and wadirelated terraces were generated by down cutting. Only landforms from the past three to four eustatic sea level cycles (i.e., approximately 300 to 400 kyr) are likely to have survived erosion and deposition associated with fluvial processes.

However, in the last two decades concern with global environmental change has brought the role of anthropogeomorphology into sharper focus. Global warming, if it occurs, will have important implications for many geomorphological processes and phenomena as a result of the direct effects of warming, as a consequence of other related climatic changes (e.g. precipitation change) and as a result of climatically moderated changes in major geomorphologically significant variables (e.g. vegetation cover). Large uncertainties exist with respect to such matters as hydrological response, the frequency of tropical cyclones, the speed and degree of permafrost degradation, the response of glaciers and ice caps, the extent of sea level rise, the reaction of beaches to rising sea levels, and the state of wetlands, deltas and coral reefs. Other human activities may serve to compound the effects of global warming on geomorphological processes. Given the uncertainties of so many of the environmental changes, there is a great need to obtain a greater understanding of the rates and mechanisms of landform response. Geomorphologists need, inter alia, to establish long-term study sites that will generate base-line data, to monitor the location and rate of change using sequential cartographic and remote sensing materials, to determine information on natural background levels and long-term trends by means of data gained from cores, to gain a more profound understanding of the operation of geomorphological systems particularly with regard to sensitivities and thresholds, and to appreciate the consequences of deliberate manipulation of environmental systems by humans.
