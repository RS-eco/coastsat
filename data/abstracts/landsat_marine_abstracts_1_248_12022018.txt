In particular, we characterized the temporal and spatial variability of turbidity and sea surface temperature (SST) in the Po River prodelta (Northern Adriatic Sea, Italy) during the period 2013-2016. To perform this analysis, a two-pronged processing methodology was implemented and the resulting outputs were analysed through a series of statistical tools. A pixel-based spatial correlation analysis was carried out by comparing temporal curves of turbidity and SST hypercubes with in situ time series of wind speed and water discharge, providing correlation coefficient maps. A geostatistical analysis was performed to determine the spatial dependency of the turbidity datasets per each satellite image, providing maps of correlation and variograms. The results show a linear correlation between water discharge and turbidity variations in the points more affected by the buoyant plumes and along the southern coast of Po River delta. Better inverse correlation was found between turbidity and SST during floods rather than other periods. The correlation maps of wind speed with turbidity show different spatial patterns depending on local or basin-scale wind effects. Variogram maps identify different spatial anisotropy structures of turbidity in response to ambient conditions (i.e. strong Bora or Scirocco winds, floods). Since the implemented processing methodology is based on open source software and free satellite data, it represents a promising tool for the monitoring of maritime ecosystems and to address water quality analyses and the investigations of sediment dynamics in estuarine and coastal waters.																	0303-2434					APR	2018	66						210	225		10.1016/j.jag.2017.11.012								WOS:000423650500019

Suspended particulate matter (SPM) dynamics has a significant impact on inland water ecology and water resource management. In-situ data in this region are scarce and, consequently, the environmental factors triggering SPM variability are yet to be understood. This study addresses these issues using remote sensing optical data. Turbidity and SPM of the Agoufou Lake in Sahelian Mali were measured from October 2014 to present, providing a large range of `values (SPM ranging from 106 to 4178 mg/L). These data are compared to satellite reflectance from Landsat (ETM+, OLI) and MODIS (MOD09GQ, MYD09GQ). For each of these sensors, a spectral band in the near infrared region is found to be well suited to retrieve turbidity and SPM, up to very high values (R-2 = 0.70) seldom addressed by remote sensing studies. The satellite estimates are then employed to assess the SPM dynamics in the main lakes and ponds of the Gourma region and its links to environmental and anthropogenic factors. The main SPM seasonal peak is observed in the rainy season (June to September) in relation to precipitation and sediment transport. A second important peak occurs during the dry season, highlighting the importance of resuspension mechanisms in maintaining high values of SPM. Three different periods are observed: first, a relatively low winds period in the early dry season, when SPM decreases rapidly due to deposition; then, a period of wind-driven resuspension in JanuaryMarch; and lastly, an SPM deposition period in April-May, when the monsoon replaces the winter trade wind. Overall, a significant increase of 27% in SPM values is observed between 2000 and 2016 in the Agoufou Lake. The significant spatio-temporal variability in SPM revealed by this study highlights the importance of high resolution optical sensors for continuous monitoring of water quality in these poorly instrumented regions.

Changing Landscape of Marine National Park and Sanctuary, Gulf of Kachchh: Ecological Assessment of Mangroves and Coral Reefs	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES INDIA SECTION A-PHYSICAL SCIENCES												This paper assesses the ecological changes in mangroves and coral reefs of Marine National Park and Sanctuary (MNP&S), Gulf of Kachchh, Gujarat, India during 1972-2014. Landsat 1 Multi Spectral Scanner data were used for 1972 to map the mangroves and coral reefs whereas Landsat 8 Optical Land Imager data were used to map the coral reef extent only, in MNP&S in 2014. Published literature sources were used to record the area of mangroves and coral reefs of MNP&S for various years between 1972 and 2014, and the changes were analyzed. For the year 1972, total mangrove area mapped is 175.36 sq. km and the total reef area mapped comes out to be 402.14 sq. km. The total area of reef in MNP&S computed for 2014 is 443.49 sq. km. Our analysis shows that MNP&S witnessed severe loss of mangroves till 1992, with annual rate of mangrove degradation being 2.89%. Exploitation by local communities and careless release/spillage of oil and brine by nearby industries were found to be two major anthropogenic factors responsible for degradation of mangroves over a period of four decades. Major reasons found for degradation of reefs in MNP&S were mining and deposition of sediments. The area estimates for coral reefs reported in this paper for 2014 are the latest figures available for coral reefs in this region. It is recommended that monitoring of coastal habitats in MNP&S should be done regularly to understand the changes in the ecology of the area.																	0369-8203	2250-1762				DEC	2017	87	4					889	900		10.1007/s40010-017-0457-3								WOS:000418819200031

For species exclusively inhabiting coastal and estuarine waters, such as the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin, Sousa chinensis, irreversible habitat loss can have dramatic implications for population viability. >A Landsat image database was used to determine the extent of coastal changes along the northern Beibu Gulf, where a large humpback dolphin population is found. The results were compared with the standardized sighting gradient (SPUF) determined from a questionnaire survey of fishermen and likely core habitats identified by application of a global digital elevation model. >Both SPUF and likely core habitat results indicated a continuous distribution of the humpback dolphin along the northern Beibu Gulf. Landsat images revealed that 129.6km(2) of coastal waters were permanently lost in the past 40years, 60km(2) within the likely core habitats. Although this may be considered small, the impact of such habitat loss could be substantial in some local habitats. >The humpback dolphin population in the northern Beibu Gulf should be regarded as one management unit, with two or more social subunits. Immediate systematic surveys are needed to fill information gaps on true distribution range and habitat-use patterns. >Habitat protection actions for dolphins in the northern Beibu Gulf should include both core and linking habitats, including enacting protected areas in core habitats, mitigating anthropogenic impacts in likely habitats, restoring both coastal waters and surrounding landscape quality, effective treatment of industrial sewage discharge, and comprehensive environmental impact assessments for the planning of coastal development projects.

Coastal landuse and land cover change and transformations of Kanyakumari coast, India using remote sensing and GIS	EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES												The coastal landuse and land cover features in the South West coast of Kanyakumari are dynamically regulated due to marine and terrestrial processes and often controlling by natural and anthropogenic activities. The primary objective of this study is to estimate the decadal changes and their transformations of landuse and land cover (LULC) features under Level II category of USGS-LULC Classification System using Landsat ETM+ and TM images using Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC) algorithm for the period 2000-2011. The classified LULC features are categorized as beachface land cover, cultivable lands, plantation and shrub vegetation, fallow land, barren land, settlements and built-ups, water bodies, and mining area, etc. The geo-database is prepared for LULC feature class with an attributes of name, location, area and spatial distribution, etc. It shows the larger area in beachface land cover (sandy beaches, foredunes, uplands, Teri dunes (laterite) and associated nearshore landforms), plantations, cultivable lands, fallows, and barren lands are converted into built-ups and it increases more than twice in the period of 10 years. Using GIS techniques, the analysis of change detection matrix reveals that the total area of 45.90 km(2) in different LULC features periodically shifted or transformed from one state to another one or more states, i.e. the beachface land cover area of 1.24 km(2) is encroached for built-ups and 0.63 km(2) for placer mining during the decade. Meanwhile, the area of 0.21 km(2) in this cover is transformed into wetlands and saltwater bodies. During the past decade, the expansion of area in the built-ups and settlements are directly proportional to the growth of population, which produces severe threat to the coastal resources. Accuracy assessment of classified images shows the overall accuracy is estimated as 81.16% and 77.52% and overall Kappa coeffient statistical values of 0.83 and 0.76 for the year 2000 and 2011 respectively. Ground truth verification of the extracted LULC features performed using 120 samples (10 samples per class) reveals that the accuracy of classified features is 89%. This indicates the acceptable accuracy of the classified LULC features for landuse and land cover change studies. The geodatabase of LULC features is used as primary source for sustainable land resource management in the coastal region. (C) 2017 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

J	Rastner, P; Strozzi, T; Paul, F				Rastner, Philipp; Strozzi, Tazio; Paul, Frank			Fusion of Multi-Source Satellite Data and DEMs to Create a New Glacier Inventory for Novaya Zemlya	REMOTE SENSING												Monitoring glacier changes in remote Arctic regions are strongly facilitated by satellite data. This is especially true for the Russian Arctic where recently increased optical and SAR satellite imagery (Landsat 8 OLI, Sentinel 1/2) and digital elevation models (TanDEM-X, ArcticDEM) are becoming available. These datasets offer new possibilities to create high-quality glacier inventories. Here, we present a new glacier inventory derived from a fusion of multi-source satellite data for Novaya Zemlya in the Russian Arctic. We mainly used Landsat 8 OLI data to automatically map glaciers with the band ratio method. Missing debris-covered glacier parts and misclassified lakes were manually corrected. Whereas perennial snow fields were a major obstacle in glacier identification, seasonal snow was identified and removed using Landsat 5 TM scenes from the year 1998. Drainage basins were derived semi-automatically using the ArcticDEM (gap-filled by the ASTER GDEM V2) and manually corrected using fringes from ALOS PALSAR. The new glacier inventory gives a glacierized area of 22,379 +/- 246.2 km(2) with 1474 glacier entities >0.05 km(2). The region is dominated by large glaciers, as 909 glaciers <0.5 km(2) (62% by number) cover only 156 +/- 1.7 km(2) or 0.7% of the area, whereas 49 glaciers >100 km(2) (3.3% by number) cover 18,724 +/- 205.9 km(2) or 84%. In total, 41 glaciers are marine terminating covering an area of 16,063.7 +/- 118.8 km(2). The mean elevation is 596 m for all glaciers in the study region (528 m in the northern part, 641 in the southern part). South-east (north-west) facing glaciers cover >35% (20%) of the area. For the smaller glaciers in the southern part we calculated an area loss of 3.4% (-52.5 +/- 3.1 km(2)) from 2001 to 2016.

Mangroves provide vital protection to Caribbean island coastline, substantial economic benefit, and crucial habitat for surrounding reef ecosystems. However, Caribbean island mangroves are shrinking as urban areas expand. Such deforestation is of considerable global environmental concern. This study applies a random forest classifier to thirteen Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Operational Land Imager (OLI) scenes from 1985 to 2015 covering Roatan, Honduras, the largest of the Bay Islands. Results indicate that urban area increased by 982.8 ha (227.7%), with 224.1 ha (-19.1%) of mangroves converted to urban areas. Island -wide and outside of protected areas, a significant relationship was found between urban expansion and mangrove loss. Designated protected reserves have stemmed cutting of mangroves and allowed mangroves to fully recover following Hurricane Mitch in 1998. However, despite being illegal under national and international laws, mangrove loss is accelerating outside of protected areas to accommodate growing urban area and tourism infrastructure. This research suggests that rapid urbanization and tourism development in the Caribbean may decrease island ecosystem resiliency to environmental stressors and impair the sustainability of tourism development.

This unique place is situated between end of Namdaecheon Stream and East Sea. It is an important environment area of the global ecosystem from the transition zone of land and marine environments by forming a variety of coastal circumstance. Some endemic species should be protected which is appearing in the Namdaecheon Stream because of preservation for future generations. Especially, the salmon return to this stream as adults in order to breed which is more than 70 % of the salmon in Korea peninsular. The monitoring of estuary sand bar is need to analyze ecological environment and sustainable development with time. First of all we represents a different shape of estuary sand bar of Namdaecheon Stream from 1984 to 2015 using Landsat satellite imagery series. Particularly movement of the "tidal inlet" is most important factor to investigate the condition of the change for estuary sand bar. The location of tidal inlet is compared with precipitation, height of tide and oceanic current data according to time variation.																	1225-6161	2287-9307				OCT	2017	33	5	1				481	493		10.7780/kjrs.2017.33.5.1.3								WOS:000422899400003

However, the process is not straightforward, the main limitation being the need for field data. The Self-calibrated Spectral Supervised Shallow-water Modeler (4SM) method was tested to obtain coastal bathymetry without the use of any field data. Using Landsat-8 multispectral images from 2013 to 2016, a bathymetric time series was produced. Groundtruthed depths and an alternative method, Stumpf's Band Ratio Algorithm, were used to verify the results. Retrieved (4SM) vs groundtruthed depths scored an average r(2) (0.90), and a low error (RMSE = 1.47 m). 4SM also showed, over the whole time series, the same average accuracy of the control method (40%). Advantages, limitations and operability under complex atmosphere and water column conditions, and high and low-albedo bottom processing capabilities of 4SM are discussed. In conclusion, the findings suggest that 4SM is as accurate as the commonly used Stumpf's method, the only difference being the independence of 4SM from previous field data, and the potential to deliver bottom spectral characteristics for further modeling. 4SM thus represents a significant advance in coastal remote sensing potential to obtain bathymetry and optical properties of the marine bottom.

Recurring Emergence of the Mud Islands on Shelf of the Arabian Sea along the Makran Coast of Pakistan - Historical Perspective using Remote Sensing Techniques	JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA												Recurring emergences of mud islands on shelf of the Arabian Sea, along the Makran coast of Pakistan are now known to be submarine mud volcanoes. They are expressions of enhanced extrusions of fluidized mud and gases coupled with compressional tectonics in convergent margin settings. Since 1945 the Malan island has emerged four times, and some other mud islands have also been emerging repeatedly, at their own positions. The first known emergence, during November 1945, was concurrent with an earthquake of magnitude 8.0 (M8.0), the 2nd and 3rd emergences, in March 1999 and November 2010 respectively, were not related apparently with earthquakes. The 4th emergence concurred with the Awaran earthquake (M7.7) of 24th September 2013. Landsat images of March 1999 and November 2010 emergences indicate appearance of round-shaped island of 4.4 and 5.2 hectare area, followed by erosion and disappearance. The island was composed of mud breccias and circular vents spewing mud slurry and methane gas. The emergence of Malan island, in March 1999 and November 2010 was compared with earthquake data before and after the emergences. The earthquakes data, two years before March 1999 and November 2010 emergences and two years afterwards, shows correlation with both small and large earthquakes, prior to the emergence, in the radius of over 400 km. It is proposed that mud islands develop in response to the episodes of enhanced mud extrusion, which inturn are related with the enhanced compressional and/or seismic events. These events are followed by periods of relative quiescence characterized by normal activity of mud extrusion and marine erosion.																	0016-7622	0974-6889				AUG	2017	90	2					201	208		10.1007/s12594-017-0700-1								WOS:000408991300011

This spatial resolution should be at least decametric. Aquatic color data processing associated with these environments requires specific atmospheric corrections (AC) suitable for the spectral characteristics of high spatial resolution sensors (HRS) as well as the high range of atmospheric and marine optical properties. The objective of the present study is to develop and demonstrate the potential of a ground-based AC approach adaptable to any HRS for regional monitoring and security of littoral systems. The in Situ-based Atmospheric CORrection (SACOR) algorithm is based on simulations provided by a Successive Order of Scattering code (SOS), which is constrained by a simple regional aerosol particle model (RAM). This RAM is defined from the mixture of a standard tropospheric and maritime aerosol type. The RAM is derived from the following two processes. The first process involved the analysis of a 6-year data set composed of aerosol optical and microphysical properties acquired through the ground-based PHOTONS/AERONET network located at Arcachon (France). The second process was related to aerosol climatology using the NOAA hybrid single-particle Lagrangian integrated trajectory (HYSPLIT) model. Results show that aerosols have a bimodal particle size distribution regardless of the season and are mainly represented by a mixed coastal continental type. Furthermore, the results indicate that aerosols originate from both the Atlantic Ocean (53.6%) and Continental Europe (46.4%). Based on these results, absorbing biomass burning, urban-industrial and desert dust particles have not been considered although they represent on average 19% of the occurrences. This represents the main current limitation of the RAM. An assessment of the performances of SACOR is then performed by inter-comparing the water-leaving reflectance (rho(w)) retrievals with three different AC methods (ACOLITE, MACCS and 6SV using three different standard aerosol types) using match-ups (N = 8) composed of Landsat-8/Operational Land Imager (OLI) scenes and field radiometric measurements. Results indicate consistency with the SWIR-based ACOLITE method, which shows the best performance, except in the green channel where SACOR matches well with the in-situ data (relative error of 7%). In conclusion, the study demonstrates the high potential of the SACOR approach for the retrieval of rho(w). In the future, the method could be improved by using an adaptive aerosol model, which may select the most relevant local aerosol model following the origin of the atmospheric air mass, and could be applied to the latest HRS (Sentinel-2/MSI, SPOT6-7, Pleiades 1A-1B).

This study presented a new bottom-up and top-down visual saliency model. We used Landsat 8, GF-1, MAMS, HJ-1 oil spill imagery as dataset. A simplified, graph-based visual saliency model was used to extract bottom-up saliency. It could identify the regions with high visual saliency object in the ocean. A spectral similarity match model was used to obtain top-down saliency. It could distinguish oil regions and exclude the other salient interference by spectrums. The regions of interest containing oil spills were integrated using these complementary saliency detection steps. Then, the genetic neural network was used to complete the image classification. These steps increased the speed of analysis. For the test dataset, the average running time of the entire process to detect regions of interest was 204.56 s. During image segmentation, the oil spill was extracted using a genetic neural network. The classification results showed that the method had a low false-alarm rate (high accuracy of 91.42%) and was able to increase the speed of the detection process (fast runtime of 19.88 s). The test image dataset was composed of different types of features over large areas in complicated imaging conditions. The proposed model was proved to be robust in complex sea conditions.																	0090-4341	1432-0703				JUL	2017	73	1			SI		154	169		10.1007/s00244-016-0358-5								WOS:000405592600015	28695250

Alexis			Post-Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Monitoring of Louisiana Salt Marshes Using Landsat Imagery	REMOTE SENSING												The Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the second largest marine oil spill in history, contaminated over a thousand kilometers of coastline in the Louisiana salt marshes and seriously threatened this valuable ecosystem. Measuring the impacts of the oil spill over the large and complex coast calls for the application of remote sensing techniques. This study develops a method for post-Deepwater Horizon oil spill monitoring of the damaged marsh vegetation using Landsat imagery. This study utilizes 10 years of Landsat data, from 2005 to 2014, to examine the longevity of the oil spill's impacts on the marsh vegetation. AVIRIS data collected between 2010 and 2012 are used to validate the Landsat results. Landsat imagery documents the significant effect of oiling on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) of the marsh vegetation in 2010 and 2011 (p < 0.01 in both cases). These results are corroborated by the AVIRIS data, which recorded the most severe impact in May 2011 followed by progressive recovery in October 2011 and October 2012. The Landsat imagery, combined with relevant environmental information and appropriate statistical tools, provides a robust and low-cost method for long-term post-oil spill monitoring of the marshes, revealing that the major aboveground impacts (at 30 m scale) of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill on Louisiana salt marshes lasted for two years. The method presented is applicable for other hazardous events whenever pre-event referencing and long-term post-event monitoring are desired, thereby offering an effective and economical tool for disaster management.																	2072-4292					JUN	2017	9	6							547	10.3390/rs9060547								WOS:000404623900038

This study researched the change in coastline and sea area of the Bohai Sea, China, over a 30-year period using Landsat TM and OLI remote sensing data. The total change in coastline length, sea area, and the centroid of the sea surface were quantified. Variations in the coastline morphology were measured using four shape indexes: fractal dimension, compact ratio, circularity, and square degree. Equations describing fit of the shape index, coastline length, and marine area were built. Then the marine area 10 years later was predicted using the model that had the highest prediction accuracy. The results showed that the highest prediction accuracy for the coastline length was obtained using a compound function. When a cubic function was used to predict the compact ratio, then the highest prediction accuracy was obtained using this compact ratio and a quadratic function to predict sea area. This study can provide theoretical support for the coastal development planning and ecological environment protection around the Bohai Sea.																	2071-1050					JUN	2017	9	6							900	10.3390/su9060900								WOS:000404133200031

Large-scale coastal land reclamation can have adverse effects on the coastal environment, including loss of marine habitats and deterioration of coastal water quality. In recent decades, coastal land reclamation has occurred extensively to meet the increasing needs of rapid economic development and urbanization in China. The overall objective of this study is to understand the coastal reclamation status of China from 1979 to 2014 and analyzed its driving factors for mitigating negative ecological effects. The data of coastal reclamation were done with the ERDAS Imagine V9.2 platform and ArcGIS software based on remote images including Landsat, SPOT, ZY-2 and ZY-3. Potential driving factors for sea reclamation were selected based on statistics bulletins and the knowledge of experts in coastal management. In order to understand the relationships among possible impact factors and coastal reclamation, the Partial Least-Squares Regression models was constructed. The analysis results indicated that the total area of reclamation was 11162.89 km(2) based on remote sensing images between 1979 and 2014. Shandong Province is the largest reclamation area, reaching 2736.54 km(2), and the reclamation is mainly concentrated in Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Liaoning, where the reclamation areas were all more than 1000 km(2). According to the remote sensing images, there are three coastal reclamation hotspot regions including Bohai bay (in which is located Liaoning, Tianjin and Hebei), Jiangsu province coastal area and Hangzhou bay (in Zhejiang province). A large scale land reclamation plan of more than 5880 km(2) has been made by local government and 2469 km(2) has approved by the State Council. From the analyzed results, there is a significant collinearity between these indicators, and no significant correlation between the area of reclamation and selected indicators. Economic development and employees in marine industries have weak positive correlation and correspondingly, the area of cultivated land (ACL) had a negative correlation. Because of the weak correlation, there is an assumption that economic development, outcome of coastal reclamation and population growth were not only was the direct driving factor, but also the outcome of coastal reclamation and population growth was not the direct driving indicator. Construction land quota and huge economic returns to local government may be the direct driving factors according to our field investigation. To resolve the contradiction between the need for land and coastal wetland conservation, it is recommended that China should establish a special management agency and coordination mechanisms, reconsidered the implementation of the reclamation plans and projects that have been approved, enhance law enforcement and increase penalties and strengthen public participation in reclamation management.

Turbidity in Apalachicola Bay, Florida from Landsat 5 TM and Field Data: Seasonal Patterns and Response to Extreme Events	REMOTE SENSING												Synoptic monitoring of estuaries, some of the most bio-diverse and productive environments on Earth, is essential to study small-scale water dynamics and its role on spatiotemporal variation in water quality important to indigenous marine species and surrounding human settlements. We present a detailed study of turbidity, an optical index of water quality, in Apalachicola Bay, Florida (USA) using historical in situ measurements and Landsat 5 TM data archive acquired from 2004 to 2011. Data mining techniques such as time-series decomposition, principal component analysis, and classification tree-based models were utilized to decipher time-series for examining variations in physical forcings, and their effects on diurnal and seasonal variability in turbidity in Apalachicola Bay. Statistical analysis showed that the bay is highly dynamic in nature, both diurnally and seasonally, and its water quality (e.g., turbidity) is largely driven by interactions of different physical forcings such as river discharge, wind speed, tides, and precipitation. River discharge and wind speed are the most influential forcings on the eastern side of river mouth, whereas all physical forcings were relatively important to the western side close to the major inlet, the West Pass. A bootstrap-optimized and atmospheric-corrected single-band empirical relationship (Turbidity (NTU) = 6568.23 x (Reflectance (Band 3))(1.95); R-2 = 0.77 +/- 0.06, range = 0.50-0.91, N = 50) is proposed with seasonal thresholds for its application in various seasons. The validation of this relationship yielded R-2 = 0.70 +/- 0.15 (range = 0.96-0.97; N = 38; RMSE = 7.78 +/- 2.59 NTU; Bias (%) = 8.70 +/- 11.48). Complex interactions of physical forcings and their effects on water dynamics have been discussed in detail using Landsat 5 TM-based turbidity maps during major events between 2004 and 2011. Promising results of the single-band turbidity algorithm with Landsat 8 OLI imagery suggest its potential for long-term monitoring of water turbidity in a shallow water estuary such as Apalachicola Bay.

The maintenance of high quality of inland water status necessitates development of means for rapid quality monitoring. Imaging spectrometry techniques are proven technology that can provide useful information for the estimation of inland water quality attributes due to fast speed, noninvasiveness, ease of use, and in situ operation. Although there have been many studies conducted on the use of imaging spectrometry for marine water quality monitoring and assessment, relatively few studies have considered inland water bodies. The aim of this review is to present an overview of imaging spectrometry technologies for the monitoring of inland waters including spaceborne and airborne and field or ground-based hyperspectral systems. Some viewpoints on the current situation and suggestions for future research directions are also proposed.																	0049-6979	1573-2932				APR	2017	228	4							131	10.1007/s11270-017-3294-8								WOS:000399872600010

In situ measured Rrs at Operational Land Imager (OLI) bands 1-4 were involved in the algorithm development. Comparisons between estimated and in situ measured SSS produced Res reaching 0.74 and RMSEs <2%. The proposed algorithm was applied to OLI scenes collected in November 2013 and March 2016 to demonstrate SSS changes from normal conditions when extreme events were encountered. The good agreement between satellite derived and in situ Rrs suggested that the algorithm uncertainties were primarily attributed to the algorithm parameterization and more measurements were required for performance improving. Compared with OLI-derived products, numerical simulations overestimated SSS by 3.4%. Our findings demonstrate the potential of high resolution satellite products to study short-lasting events and capture fine-scale features in the marine environment. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

These features could be continuously changed according to the nature of a waterway and human activities. Hence, using the old or uncorrected NC for navigation is strongly prohibited. Moreover, the adequacy of NC is a must for the safety of the seaway before navigation. The general manner of ensuring the adequacy of NC is to access the change in bathymetry along with the vessel traffic information in seaway. The recent bathymetry update is commonly done by using hydrographic surveying techniques, such as Multi-Beam Echo Sounder (MBES) and Airborne LiDAR Bathymetry (ALB). These techniques provide both highly accurate and a dense coverage of depth measurements. However, high cost and logistic challenges are required. This study applied the satellite-derived bathymetry from Landsat imagery with Auto Identification System (AIS) data as vessel traffic information to evaluate the adequacy and completeness of NC information in the coastal area around Incheon Bay, Korea. Based on satellite data, submarine topography was derived and found to be very highly correlated up to 10m depth. The procedure can easily identify the changes of bathymetric information in NC and could be an effective and economic way of ensuring the NC adequacy without MBES or ALB surveying in the coastal area of Korea.

J	Altena, B; Kaab, A				Altena, Bas; Kaab, Andreas			Elevation Change and Improved Velocity Retrieval Using Orthorectified Optical Satellite Data from Different Orbits	REMOTE SENSING												Optical satellite products are available at different processing levels. Of these products, terrain corrected (i.e., orthorectified) products are the ones mostly used for glacier displacement estimation. For terrain correction, a digital elevation model (DEM) is used that typically stems from various data sources with variable qualities, from dispersed time instances, or with different spatial resolutions. Consequently, terrain representation used for orthorectifying satellite images is often in disagreement with reality at image acquisition. Normally, the lateral orthoprojection offsets resulting from vertical DEM errors are taken into account in the geolocation error budget of the corrected images, or may even be neglected. The largest offsets of this type are often found over glaciers, as these may show strong elevation changes over time and thus large elevation errors in the reference DEM with respect to image acquisition. The detection and correction of such orthorectification offsets is further complicated by ice flow which adds a second offset component to the displacement vectors between orthorectified data. Vice versa, measurement of glacier flow is complicated by the inherent superposition of ice movement vectors and orthorectification offset vectors. In this study, we try to estimate these orthorectification offsets in the presence of terrain movement and translate them to elevation biases in the reference surface. We demonstrate our method using three different sites which include very dynamic glaciers. For the Oriental Glacier, an outlet of the Southern Patagonian icefield, Landsat 7 and 8 data from different orbits enabled the identification of trends related to elevation change. For the Aletsch Glacier, Swiss Alps, we assess the terrain offsets of both Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2A: a superior DEM appears to be used for Landsat in comparison to Sentinel-2, however a systematic bias is observed in the snow covered areas. Lastly, we demonstrate our methodology in a pipeline structure; displacement estimates for the Helheim-glacier, in Greenland, are mapped and corrected for orthorectification offsets between data from different orbits, which enables a twice as dense a temporal resolution of velocity data, as compared to the standard method of measuring velocities from repeat-orbit data only. In addition, we introduce and implement a novel matching method which uses image triplets. By formulating the three image displacements as a convolution, a geometric constraint can be exploited. Such a constraint enhances the reliability of the displacement estimations. Furthermore the implementation is simple and computationally swift.

J	Huber, J; Cook, AJ; Paul, F; Zemp, M				Huber, Jacqueline; Cook, Alison J.; Paul, Frank; Zemp, Michael			A complete glacier inventory of the Antarctic Peninsula based on Landsat 7 images from 2000 to 2002 and other preexisting data sets	EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA												The glaciers on the Antarctic Peninsula (AP) potentially make a large contribution to sea level rise. However, this contribution has been difficult to estimate since no complete glacier inventory (outlines, attributes, separation from the ice sheet) is available. This work fills the gap and presents a new glacier inventory of the AP north of 70 degrees S, based on digitally combining preexisting data sets with geographic information system (GIS) techniques. Rock outcrops have been removed from the glacier basin outlines of Cook et al. (2014) by intersection with the latest layer of the Antarctic Digital Database (Burton-Johnson et al., 2016). Glacier-specific topographic parameters (e.g., mean elevation, slope and aspect) as well as hypsometry have been calculated from the DEM of Cook et al. (2012). We also assigned connectivity levels to all glaciers following the concept by Rastner et al. (2012). Moreover, the bedrock data set of Huss and Farinotti (2014) enabled us to add ice thickness and volume for each glacier. The new inventory is available from the Global Land Ice Measurements from Space (GLIMS) database (doi: 10.7265/N5V98602) and consists of 1589 glaciers covering an area of 95 273 km(2), slightly more than the 89 720 km(2) covered by glaciers surrounding the Greenland Ice Sheet. Hence, compared to the preexisting data set of Cook et al. (2014), this data set covers a smaller area and one glacier less due to the intersection with the rock outcrop data set. The total estimated ice volume is 34 590 km3, of which one-third is below sea level. The hypsometric curve has a bimodal shape due to the unique topography of the AP, which consists mainly of ice caps with outlet glaciers. Most of the glacierized area is located at 200-500ma. s.l., with a secondary maximum at 1500-1900 m. Approximately 63% of the area is drained by marine-terminating glaciers, and ice-shelf tributary glaciers cover 35% of the area. This combination indicates a high sensitivity of the glaciers to climate change for several reasons: (1) only slightly rising equilibrium-line altitudes would expose huge additional areas to ablation, (2) rising ocean temperatures increase melting of marine terminating glaciers, and (3) ice shelves have a buttressing effect on their feeding glaciers and their collapse would alter glacier dynamics and strongly enhance ice loss (Rott et al., 2011). The new inventory should facilitate modeling of the related effects using approaches tailored to glaciers for a more accurate determination of their future evolution and contribution to sea level rise.																	1866-3508	1866-3516				FEB 15	2017	9	1					115	131		10.5194/essd-9-115-2017								WOS:000395159800001						
J	Pu, R; Bell, S				Pu, Ruiliang; Bell, Susan			Mapping seagrass coverage and spatial patterns with high spatial resolution IKONOS imagery	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												Seagrass habitats in subtidal coastal waters provide a variety of ecosystem functions and services and there is an increasing need to acquire information on spatial and temporal dynamics of this resource. Here, we explored the capability of IKONOS (IKO) data of high resolution (4m) for mapping seagrass cover [submerged aquatic vegetation (%SAV) cover] along the mid-western coast of Florida, USA. We also compared seagrass maps produced with IKO data with that obtained using the Landsat TM sensor with lower resolution (30m). Both IKO and TM data, collected in October 2009, were preprocessed to calculate water depth invariant bands to normalize the effect of varying depth on bottom spectra recorded by the two satellite sensors and further the textural information was extracted from IKO data. Our results demonstrate that the high resolution IKO sensor produced a higher accuracy than the TM sensor in a three-class % SAV cover classification. Of note is that the OA of %SAV cover mapping at our study area created with IKO data was 5-20% higher than that from other studies published. We also examined the spatial distribution of seagrass over a spatial range of 4-240 m using the Ripley's K function [L(d)] and IKO data that represented four different grain sizes [4 m (one IKO pixel), 8 m (2 x 2 IKO pixels), 12 m (3 x 3 IKO pixels), and 16 m (4 x 4 IKO pixels)] from moderate-dense seagrass cover along a set of six transects. The Ripley's K metric repeatedly indicated that seagrass cover representing 4m x 4m pixels displayed a dispersed (or slightly dispersed) pattern over distances of <4-8 m, and a random or slightly clustered pattern of cover over 9-240m. The spatial pattern of seagrass cover created with the three additional grain sizes (i.e., 2 x 24m IKO pixels, 3 x 34m IKO pixels, and 4 x 4m IKO pixels) show a dispersed (or slightly dispersed) pattern across 4-32 m and a random or slightly clustered pattern across 33-240m. Given the first report on using satellite observations to quantify seagrass spatial patterns at a spatial scale from 4m to 240m, our novel analyses of moderate-dense SAV cover utilizing Ripley's K function illustrate how data obtained from the IKO sensor revealed seagrass spatial information that would be undetected by the TM sensor with a 30 m pixel size. Use of the seagrass classification scheme here, along with data from the IKO sensor with enhanced resolution, offers an opportunity to synoptically record seagrass cover dynamics at both small and large spatial scales.(C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Quantifying suspended sediment concentration in subglacial sediment plumes discharging from two Svalbard tidewater glaciers using Landsat-8 and in situ measurements	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Marine-terminating outlet glaciers discharge mass through iceberg calving, submarine melting, and meltwater run-off. While calving can be quantified by in situ and remote-sensing observations, meltwater run-off, the subglacial transport of meltwater, and submarine melting are not well constrained due to inherent difficulties observing the subglacial and proglacial environments at tidewater glaciers. Remote-sensing and in situ measurements of surface sediment plumes, and their suspended sediment concentration (SSC), have been used as a proxy for glacier meltwater run-off. However, this relationship between satellite reflectance and SSC has predominantly been established using land-terminating glaciers. Here, we use two Svalbard tidewater glaciers to establish a well-constrained relationship between Landsat-8 surface reflecance and SSC and argue that it can be used to measure relative meltwater runoff at tidewater glaciers throughout a summer melt season. We find the highest correlation between SSCs and Landsat-8 surface reflectance by using the red + NIR band combination (r(2) = 0.76). The highest correlation between SSCs and in situ field spectrometer measurements is in the 740-800 nm wavelength range (r(2) = 0.85), a spectral range not currently measured by Landsat. Additionally, we find that in situ and Landsat-8 measurements for surface reflectance of SSCs are not interchangeable and therefore establish a relationship for each detection method. We then use the Landsat-8 relationship to calculate total surface sediment load, finding a strong correlation between total surface sediment load and a proxy for meltwater run-off (r(2) = 0.89). Our results establish a new metric to calculate SSCs from Landsat-8 surface reflectance and demonstrate how the SSC of subglacial sediment plumes can be used to monitor relative seasonal meltwater discharge at tidewater glaciers.																	0143-1161	1366-5901					2017	38	23					6865	6881		10.1080/01431161.2017.1365388								WOS:000412545900021

It is considered a useful reconnaissance tool to save time and cost to be used in preliminary survey. This paper aims to assess the performance of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) in estimating the bathymetry of the Eastern harbor of Alexandria Egypt as a case study. This area of the case study represents a low turbid, mud bottom and shallow water area. The estimation of shallow water depth is based on ANN fitting algorithms using the logarithms of multispectral bands reflectance value. The estimation of water depths using optical bands of Landsat-8 multispectral images is extracted directly without regard to other environmental factors (bottom type and sea sediments).The images are first corrected for the effects caused by atmospheric conditions and sun specular. The bands are then calibrated using reference measurements obtained using GPS and single beam echo sounder in the study area. The estimated depths using ANN based on bands 1&3, 3 only and 2&3 show higher correlations and lower root mean square error compared the estimation made by previously developed statistically equations which were updated using the same data sets used in developing the ANNs. The ANN has a better capability to estimate the bathymetry using remotely -sensed data extracted from Landsat-8 images. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

S	Zhu, CM; Zhang, X		Zhang, X; Wang, L; Jiang, X; Zhu, C		Zhu, Changming; Zhang, Xin			Coastal Remote Sensing	MODELING WITH DIGITAL OCEAN AND DIGITAL COAST	Coastal Research Library											Coastal zones are a junction between the land and the ocean. The dynamic nature of the coast makes it difficult to clearly define the borders of coastal zones. Sometimes these zones are referred to as tidewater areas, extending from the coast to approximately 10 miles inland. Ketchum defined a coastal zone as the band of dry land and adjacent ocean space (water and submerged land) in which terrestrial processes and land uses directly affect oceanic processes and uses and vice versa (Ketchum BH, The water's edge: critical problems of the Coastal zone. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 1972). Coastal zones are one of the most ecologically valuable and biodiverse regions in the world. They provide food, freshwater and other marine products for human beings, as well as play an important role in the local environment. However, human activities and global climate change have given rise to natural disasters that threaten coastal zones environmental security. In particular, the effect of industrial projects on coastal zones is worsening. Thus, it is important to study these areas to provide guidance for coastal resource management and environmental protection. Numerous researchers have attempted to monitor coastal zone dynamics based on remote sensing data. In this chapter, we summarize various topics concerning the application of remote sensing in coastal zones. We focus on describing several new methods, including coastline automatic extraction, intertidal zone identification, coastal wetland classification and coastal invasive plant detection, using remote sensing.																	2211-0577		978-3-319-42710-2; 978-3-319-42708-9				2017	18						169	203		10.1007/978-3-319-42710-2_8	10.1007/978-3-319-42710-2							WOS:000399043100009

Conventional measurements of light attenuation in the PAR domain (K-d(PAR)) is representative for only small areas of water body. Remotely sensed optical imagery can be utilized to monitor K-d(PAR) in large areas of water bodies, based on the relationship between water leaving radiance and K-d(PAR). In this study, six field surveys were conducted over 20 lakes (or reservoirs) across Northeast China from April to September 2015. In order to derive the K-d(PAR) at regional scale, the Landsat/TM/ETM+/OLI and the MODIS daily surface reflectance data (MOD09GA similar to 500 m, Bands 17) were used to establish empirical inversion models. Through multiple stepwise regression analysis, the band difference (Red-Blue) and band ratio (NIR/Red) were used in Landsat imagery modeling, and the band difference (Red-Blue) and ratio (Red/Blue) were used in MODIS imagery modeling. The accuracy of the two models was evaluated by 10-fold cross-validation in ten times. The results indicate that the models performed well for both Landsat (R-2 = 0.83, RMSE = 0.95, and MRE = 0.33), and MODIS (R-2 = 0.86, RMSE = 0.91, and MRE = 0.19) imagery. However, the K-d(PAR) derived by MODIS is slightly higher than that estimated by Landsat (slope = 1.203 and R-2 = 0.972). Consistency of model performance between the MODIS daily (MYDO9G A) and the 8-Day composite reflectance (MYDO9A1) data was verified by K-d(PAR) estimations and regression analysis (slope = 1.044 and R-2 = 0.966). Finally, the spatial and temporal distribution of K-d(PAR) in Northeast China indicated that specific geographical characteristics as well as meteorological alterations can influence K-d(PAR) calibrations. Specifically, we have revealed that the wind speed and algal bloom are the major determinants of K-d(PAR) in Lake Hulun (2050 km(2)) and Xingkai (4412 km(2)).

Best performing algorithms are different in the different regions of the Baltic Sea. Moreover, there is indication that the algorithms have to be seasonal as the optical properties of phytoplankton assemblages dominating in spring and summer are different. We modelled 15,600 reflectance spectra using HydroLight radiative transfer model to test 58 previously published empirical algorithms. 7200 of the spectra were modelled using specific inherent optical properties (SIOPs) of the open parts of the Baltic Sea in summer and 8400 with SIOPs of spring season. Concentration range of chlorophyll-a, coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and suspended matter used in the model simulations were based on the actually measured values available in literature. For each optically active constituent we added one concentration below actually measured minimum and one concentration above the actually measured maximum value in order to test the performance of the algorithms in wider range. 77 in situ reflectance spectra from rocky (Sweden) and sandy (Estonia, Latvia) coastal areas were used to evaluate the performance of the algorithms also in coastal waters. Seasonal differences in the algorithm performance were confirmed but we found also algorithms that can be used in both spring and summer conditions. The algorithms that use bands available on OLCI, launched in February 2016, are highlighted as this sensor will be available for Baltic Sea monitoring for coming decades.

This study evaluated the potential of an oyster Suitability Sites Occurrence Model (SSOM) to predict the status of littoral areas in the future due to sea warming. Data sources comprised Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat 7 ETM+. The suitable sites were ranked on a scale of 1 (least suitable) to 5 (most suitable). In the suitability model, score 5 had the highest proportion (35.8%) of oyster suitability which shrank to 16.2% with a 4 degrees C increase in sea temperature. Future increases in sea temperature are likely to cause shrinkage in the spatial extent of most suitable and suitable oyster sites. Thus changes in marine oyster suitability in littoral zones are predicted to worsen gradually as sea temperatures increase in the future. Differences in the recorded sea temperature of <= 6 degrees C within and between sites may influence spatial variations in oyster habitat due to future sea warming. Such concepts could form an alternative scientific basis for quantification of potential global climate change effects on biodiversity for marine systems policy adaptation analysis, aquaculture potential, and management.

Additionally, these charts may have been compiled using inadequate data and contain unsurveyed areas. However, with more days per year of diminished Arctic sea-ice coverage, including along the North Slope, marine transportation in this region has increased during the past decade, thus increasing the need for updated nautical charts. Due to limited resources available for U.S. Arctic surveying, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is evaluating the capabilities of satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB). This technology has proven useful as a reconnaissance tool in tropical and subtropical waters and clear-water conditions, especially over sandy seafloor. But in the Arctic, glacial flour from land reduces water clarity and limits the light penetration depth, which may affect SDB calculations. A new multi-temporal SDB approach is described in this paper using multiple images to extract "clear water" areas acquired on different dates. As a proof-of-concept, the extinction depth and bathymetry were calculated over areas that overlap with NOAA Charts 16081 and 16082 using Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 imagery. The derived and charted bathymetry are similar in most areas up to 4.5 m deep. The results of the study also identified a potential uncharted shoal. The multi-temporal SDB approach was further investigated by NOAA and was used to process imagery for other areas along Alaska's North Slope. As a result, the new editions of NOAA Chart 16081 include the location of a potential uncharted shoal, which is the first time an SDB product was utilized for a NOAA chart.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				WIN	2016					76		56	63		10.2112/SI76-006								WOS:000391817900006

Unlike previous studies that focused on the extraction of topographic changes from intertidal digital elevation models (DEMs), information on landform change is assessed in the present study by considering both topography and surface sediment characteristics. DEMs in 2000 and 2010 were first generated using waterlines extracted from 16 Landsat images. Mean grain size distribution maps were also generated by interpolating sample data acquired in the field in 2002 and 2012. The non-spatial and spatial characteristics of the landform change in the study area were then analyzed using contingency table plots and difference maps, respectively. Overall sedimentation and coarsening of surface sediments caused by different local marine energy environments were dominant in the study area during the 10-year period. The combined analysis also revealed a close relationship between the changes in topography and grain size. Sedimentation was dominant mainly in areas with fine-grained sediments, while a coarsening trend in the sediments increased with elevation. Moreover, it was possible to locate specific areas in which erosion and a fining trend of surface sediments were observed, which differed from the overall trend of change in the study area. These case study results indicate that the combined analysis of both topography and surface sediment characteristics is very useful in the exploration and monitoring of landform changes in tidal flats.																	1023-2796					DEC	2016	24	6					1070	1080		10.6119/JMST-016-0729-1								WOS:000391418600004

However, they are degrading because of various causes, such as the anthropogenic impacts of coastal development, aquaculture, overharvesting, and climate change. To contribute to the research related to coastal blue carbon and marine biodiversity as well as conservation and sustainable management of natural resources in coastal regions, the spatial distribution of benthic cover derived from satellite images can be the most practical tool for monitoring seaweed and seagrass beds. This study aimed at mapping the latest distribution of seaweed and seagrass in Thailand using Landsat 8 images. Thus, we developed a classification method that includes regional segmentation by ISODATA clustering, analysis of optical and textural properties, and classification using a decision tree. First, a subset of images, including those of the Sirinat National Park in Phuket, Southern Thailand, was extracted from the Landsat 8 full-scene images as a training site for the development of a classification method. Then, the developed method was evaluated by comparing the classification result to a visual interpretation result. The classification and visual interpretation results were found to be consistent to each other with a 98% total accuracy. Next, the method was applied to the Landsat 8 full-scene image, and quality assessment was conducted at two different water-type areas: Patong Beach and Tang Ken Bay. At Patong Beach, which has clear seawater, the classification result was consistent with the result of the training site. However, in the Tang Ken Bay, where the seawater is turbid, misclassification of the result evidently occurred. It is believed that the segmentation sizes were not appropriate for benthic cover distributed over small areas, and that the thresholds utilized in the decision tree were not suitable for turbid water.																	1023-2796					DEC	2016	24	6					1155	1160		10.6119/JMST-016-1026-4								WOS:000391418600013

Shrinking of Vann Island, Gulf of Mannar, SE coast of India: assessing the impacts	NATURAL HAZARDS												Vaan Island, which is one of 21 islands in Gulf of Mannar Marine National Park, is chosen as study area which is formed above the coral reef by sedimentation and deposition of tidal and current activities. By using Landsat images, the area (Vann Island) was calculated from the year 1973-2015 with analyzing tools of Qgis and Saga Gis. Multispectral Landsat images were processed to extract and delineate the interface line of island surface and seawater. The area of each year polygon vector is calculated using the Qgis field calculator tool. During the 1973, the area of Vaan Island is about 265,479 m(2) and at present the area is calculated as 40,733 m(2). About 84 % of the island area is reduced and inundated by the seawater due to sea level rise and anthropogenic activities such as coral sand mining, local tourism and fishing activities. At this rate of submergence, it can be predicted that by 2022 Vaan Island will completely submerge into the sea. From this study, it is concluded that geospatial techniques are one of the successful and reliable techniques to map this type of low-lying island to conserve and manage the resources that affected by the geogenic and anthropogenic processes.																	0921-030X	1573-0840				DEC	2016	84	3					1529	1538		10.1007/s11069-016-2496-5								WOS:000388187900002						
J	Moreno-de las Heras, M; Gallart, F				Moreno-de las Heras, Mariano; Gallart, Francesc			Lithology controls the regional distribution and morphological diversity of montane Mediterranean badlands in the upper Llobregat basin (eastern Pyrenees)	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Badlands are pervasive in a wide range of environmental conditions across the Mediterranean region, including arid, semiarid, and humid environments. On montane (cold subhumid and humid) Mediterranean landscapes, harsh thermal conditions on north-facing hillslopes favour intense bedrock weathering by freezing and impose serious constraints on plant colonization. The above are the customary arguments to explain the high abundance of montane badlands on north-exposed shady aspects. We studied the distribution and morphological diversity of badlands in the upper Llobregat basin (Catalan Pyrenees, NE Spain), using remote sensing information (high resolution orthophotos and complementary Landsat 8 imagery), digital elevation data, and regional information on lithology. Badlands extend over about 200 ha in the upper Llobregat basin and occur on two different parent materials, swelling (smectite-rich) continental Garumnian lutites of late Cretaceous age, and nonswelling (illitic) marine Eocene marls. Vegetation, assessed by remote-sensed vegetation greenness, is less developed on north facing badland slopes. However, badland slope-aspect distribution varies considerably with lithology. While badlands on Eocene marls show preferential distribution on north-facing shady slopes, badland occurrence on Garumnian lutites does not reveal clear slope-aspect anisotropy patterns. Lithology also affects slope gradient, with badlands on Eocene marls showing rougher topography (30-40 degrees average slope angle) than on Garumnian lutites (20-30 degrees). Badland morphological differences induced by lithology are discussed in terms of the greater weathering susceptibility and slope instability of the swelling, smectite-rich Garumnian lutites than of the nonswelling Eocene marls. Elevation, which broadly controls annual precipitation and winter air temperature within the region, shows no clear influence on badland distribution. Overall, our results reveal lithology as the main factor controlling badland distribution and morphological diversity under the montane Mediterranean conditions of the upper Llobregat basin.

J	Duan, YW; Liu, YX; Li, MC; Zhou, MX; Yang, YH				Duan Yuewei; Liu Yongxue; Li Manchun; Zhou Minxi; Yang Yuhao			Survey of reefs based on Landsat 8 operational land imager (OLI) images in the Nansha Islands, South China Sea	ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA												A detailed survey of the reefs in the Nansha Islands' sea that are of strategic importance is conducive to their future development. In this study, a total of 50 Landsat 8 operational land imager (OLI) images were used to analyze the geological features and spectral characteristics of the Nansha reefs. The exposed islands/sandbanks, reef flats and sub-tidal reefs were identified with the near-infrared band, the red and green bands, and the blue band, respectively. Based on the relationships among various characteristics and bands illustrated in the OLI images, the maximum between-cluster variance threshold algorithm (OTSU method) and the mathematical morphology were employed to extract characteristic parameters of the spatial geometry of the reefs from top to bottom, which were subsequently operated by a series of post-processing methods such as vectorization, simplification and topological analysis. Among the 132 standalone reefs and 16 atolls that are identified in the study, four reefs have yet to be named in the Standard Names of Various Islands in the South China Sea and the website Nansha Islands Online (http://www.nansha.org/). Another 24 ones are exposed to the atmosphere even during high tides. Taiping Island with an area of 0.57 km(2) represents the largest exposed geological feature. This study demonstrated the applicability of medium-resolution satellite images to derive the coral reef information effectively and thus provided information for the related departments that are responsible to manage the coast. An improved resolution of multispectral bands with the panchromatic band in higher spatial resolution (15 m for OLI image) is expected to provide an optimum satellite based approach to map marine habitats.																	0253-505X	1869-1099				OCT	2016	35	10					11	19		10.1007/s13131-016-0898-6								WOS:000385152000002

Achieving the above commitment requires detailed baseline information on the spatial distribution and extent of the marine resources, such as seagrass meadows, coral reef, mangrove fotests and seaweed beds, as well as the ability to successfully interpret and understand these data. This study examined a combination of Landsat image enhancement technique and pixel-bated regional growing tools to create a map of marine and human habitats with five classes-of-interest: seagrass, land, coral and coral rubble, subsurface sand/mud, land, and human habitats for twelve islands of eastern Sabah of East Malaysia (extending from 4 degrees 42' N, 118 degrees 31' E to 4 degrees 12' N, 118 degrees 50' E), located in the south-eastern boundary of Palawan/North Borneo Ecoregion (extending from 14 degrees 31' N, 116 degrees 52' E to 0 degrees 0.04'N, 122 degrees 12' E) of the CTI implementation area. Using this method, an overall accuracy of > 75% was achieved for mapping of those class-of-interest types. The estimated seagrass areal coverage is 274 ha, of which 158 ha (58% of the total area) occurred in relatively shallow water areas. Using Google Earth data, seaweed culture sites with a total area of 7114 ha were observed around 7 of the 12 islands. The mapping approach and the results of the study will be of immense benefit to natural resource management of the study area through enabling conservation agencies to prioritize seagrass, coral, seaweed or marine conservation sites and to document local threats to those habitats.

Geospatial approach towards enumerative analysis of suspended sediment concentration for Ganges-Brahmaputra Bay	COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES												This study presents an easy, modular, user-friendly, and flexible software package for processing of Landsat 7 ETM and Landsat 8 OLI-TIRS data for estimating suspended particulate matter concentrations in the coastal waters. This package includes 1) algorithm developed using freely downloadable SCILAB package, 2) ERDAS Models for iterative processing of Landsat images and 3) ArcMAP tool for plotting and map making. Utilizing SCILAB package, a module is written for geometric corrections, radiometric corrections and obtaining normalized water-leaving reflectance by incorporating Landsat 8 OLI-TIRS and Landsat 7 ETM+ data. Using ERDAS models, a sequence of modules are developed for iterative processing of Landsat images and estimating suspended particulate matter concentrations. Processed images are used for preparing suspended sediment concentration maps. The applicability of this software package is demonstrated by estimating and plotting seasonal suspended sediment concentration maps off the Bengal delta. The software is flexible enough to accommodate other remotely sensed data like Ocean Color monitor (OCM) data, Indian Remote Sensing data (IRS), MODIS data etc. by replacing a few parameters in the algorithm, for estimating suspended sediment concentration in coastal waters.

Long-term monitoring of seagrass beds is critical to understanding the dynamic relationships between the ecosystems and the stresses from natural systems and society. This study investigated temporal changes of seagrass beds in Cam Ranh Bay (CRB), Vietnam using multi temporal Landsat data from 1996 to 2015. The data were processed through 5 main steps including: (1) image preprocessing to convert Landsat data to the top of atmosphere reflectance (TOA) and to correct atmospheric effects, (2) water column correction to eliminate effects on remotely sensed data of aquatic environments, (3) image classification using a linear mixed model, (4) accuracy assessment using the ground reference data, and (5) change detection of seagrass beds. The classification results compared with the ground reference data indicated that the overall accuracies and Kappa coefficients were higher than 91.7% and 0.8, respectively, in all cases. From 1996 to 2015, the total area of seagrass beds had declined by approximately 25% (66 ha), mainly attributed to coastal development and infrastructure construction. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

While advances in in-situ chem/bio-sensing continue to be reported, costs and reliability issues still inhibit the implementation of large-scale deployments. In contrast, physical parameters like surface temperature can be tracked on a global scale using satellite remote sensing, and locally at high resolution via flyovers and drones using multi-spectral imaging. In this study, we show how a much more complete picture of submarine and intertidal groundwater discharge patterns in Kinvara Bay, Galway can be achieved using a fusion of data collected from the Earth Observation satellite (Landsat 8), small aircraft and in-situ sensors. Over the course of the four-day field campaign, over 65,000 in-situ temperatures, salinity and nutrient measurements were collected in parallel with high-resolution thermal imaging from aircraft flyovers. The processed in-situ data show highly correlated patterns between temperature and salinity at the southern end of the bay where freshwater springs can be identified at low tide. Salinity values range from 1 to 2 ppt at the southern end of the bay to 30 ppt at the mouth of the bay, indicating the presence of a freshwater wedge. The data clearly show that temperature differences can be used to track the dynamics of freshwater and seawater mixing in the inner bay region. This outcome suggests that combining the tremendous spatial density and wide geographical reach of remote temperature sensing (using drones, flyovers and satellites) with ground-truthing via appropriately located in-situ sensors (temperature, salinity, chemical, and biological) can produce a much more complete and accurate picture of the water dynamics than each modality used in isolation.

The rifting process has formed rotated fault blocks which provide numerous play types in the resulting basins. Interpretation of 2D seismic data from 1984 indicated that sufficient sediment thickness is present for hydrocarbon generation. The prospectivity of the lake sediment sequence is enhanced by large oil discoveries further north along the rift system at Lake Albert in Uganda. Airborne gravity gradiometry (AGG) has been used in the Lake Albert region to delineate the structural framework of sedimentary basins. Based on this analogy, in 2010 Beach Energy commissioned CGG to fly a FALCON AGG and high-resolution airborne magnetic survey over the Lake Tanganyika South block to provide data for mapping the basin architecture and estimating the depth to magnetic basement. A total of nearly 28000 line kilometres of data were acquired. The subsequent interpretation incorporated the AGG and magnetic data with available 2D seismic data, elevation model data, bathymetry, Landsat and regional geology information. The integrated data interpretation revealed that the Lake Tanganyika rifting structures occur as half-grabens that were formed through reactivation of Precambrian fault structures. Two major depocentres were identified in the magnetic depth-to-basement map in the north and in the west-central part of the survey area with sediment thicknesses in excess of 4 km and 3 km, respectively. Smaller, shallower depocentres (with less than 3 km of sediment) occur in the southwestern region. This information was used to plan a 2100 km 2D marine seismic survey that was recorded in 2012. An interpretation of the results from the seismic survey confirmed a rifting structure similar to that encountered further north at Lake Albert in Uganda. Several targets were identified from the seismic sections for follow-up.																	0812-3985	1834-7533				SEP	2016	47	3					228	236		10.1071/EG15075								WOS:000383876300008

Based on the instantaneous water line position data, a new statistical method for studying annual shoreline change was proposed. The annual shoreline movement of the northern Yellow River delta after the latest deltaic course shift in 1976 was obtained. The results showed that the shoreline on northern Yellow River delta was mostly undergoing a retreat back process since 1976 due to the river course shift, relative sea level change, regional marine hydrodynamic forces and the local engineering constructions. The influence of the Yellow River deltaic course shift in 1976 on the shoreline change mainly occurred in the first 20 years in 1976-1996 after the course shift, and was mostly limited within 10 km range around the abandoned Diaokou river mouth. The coastal engineering constructions caused decrease of the erosion area by 61 km(2), or 31% of the total erosion area. Most of the northern Yellow River delta was relatively insensitive to the relative sea level change except for the coast around sections S10 and S11; The annual shoreline movement due to the relative sea level change along most of the coast was only 1-3% of the actual annual shoreline movement; the total erosion area due to the relative sea level change was 9 km(2), or 5% of the actual erosion area. The coast erosion in the northern Yellow River delta was mainly influenced by the regional marine hydrodynamic forces, which gradually increase from west to east, resulting in gradually eastward increase of annual shoreline movement and slope steepness of the coast.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				SEP	2016					74		48	58		10.2112/SI74-005.1								WOS:000383795300006

Using GIS and streamlined landforms to interpret palaeo-ice flow in northern Iceland	BOREAS												The properties of streamlined glacial landforms and palaeo-flow indicators in the valleys of Vididalur, Vatnsdalur and Svinadalur in northern Iceland were quantified using spatial analyses. Drumlins and mega-scale glacial lineations (MSGL) were visually identified using satellite imagery from Google Earth, the National Land Survey of Iceland (NLSI) Map Viewer and Landsat satellites, and using aerial photographs from the NLSI. A semi-automated technique was developed using ENVI to determine regions in northern Iceland likely to contain streamlined landforms. The outlines of the identified landforms were manually delineated in Google Earth, and all analyses were conducted in ArcGIS using a 20 m digital elevation model (DEM) of Iceland from the NLSI. Smaller features such as flutes, grooves and striations were measured in the field. At least 543 drumlins and 90 MSGL were identified in the three valleys. Average elongation ratios for Vididalur, Vatnsdalur and Svinadalur are 4.3:1, 5.2:1 and 6.7:1, respectively. The average density of streamlined landforms is 2.34 landforms per 1 km(2). Striations and orientation data of the drumlins and MSGL demonstrate ice flow to the northwest into Hunafloi. Parallel conformity is higher in the valley of Svinadalur (9 degrees standard deviation) than in Vididalur (12 degrees) and Vatnsdalur (16 degrees). Packing values are generally higher in the centre of each valley. The properties of streamlined landforms in the valleys of Vididalur, Vatnsdalur and Svinadalur support the presence of palaeo-ice stream activity on northern Iceland. Palaeo-ice streams flowed from these regions into Hunafloi, supplying ice to the margin of the Iceland Ice Sheet during the Last Glacial Maximum. These palaeo-ice streams provide a mechanism for ice centres from the mainland of Iceland to reach the shelf-slope break.																	0300-9483	1502-3885				JUL	2016	45	3					470	482		10.1111/bor.12164								WOS:000385404200007

Examination of Abiotic Drivers and Their Influence on Spartina alterniflora Biomass over a Twenty-Eight Year Period Using Landsat 5 TM Satellite Imagery of the Central Georgia Coast	REMOTE SENSING												We examined the influence of abiotic drivers on inter-annual and phenological patterns of aboveground biomass for Marsh Cordgrass, Spartina alterniflora, on the Central Georgia Coast. The linkages between drivers and plant response via soil edaphic factors are captured in our graphical conceptual model. We used geospatial techniques to scale up in situ measurements of aboveground S. alterniflora biomass to landscape level estimates using 294 Landsat 5 TM scenes acquired between 1984 and 2011. For each scene we extracted data from the same 63 sampling polygons, containing 1222 pixels covering about 1.1 million m(2). Using univariate and multiple regression tests, we compared Landsat derived biomass estimates for three S. alterniflora size classes against a suite of abiotic drivers. River discharge, total precipitation, minimum temperature, and mean sea level had positive relationships with and best explained biomass for all dates. Additional results, using seasonally binned data, indicated biomass was responsive to changing combinations of variables across the seasons. Our 28-year analysis revealed aboveground biomass declines of 33%, 35%, and 39% for S. alterniflora tall, medium, and short size classes, respectively. This decline correlated with drought frequency and severity trends and coincided with marsh die-backs events and increased snail herbivory in the second half of the study period.

However, information on the distribution of these platforms over vast areas of the sea is extremely poor partly because of business secrecy, national interests including security, and partly from bureaucratic inertia. Until recently, the automatic and accurate identification of platforms using optical imagery was challenging due to their subtle characteristics (i.e., low contrast and small size) and prevalent cloud cover. The Landsat-8 satellite, with its increasing Operational Land Imager (OLI) dataset with uniform quality and global coverage, may assist researchers in assessing the worldwide distribution of offshore platforms. Here we describe an automated method, based on time-series of OLI imagery, for extracting offshore platforms (AMEOP) which addresses the aforementioned problems. Specifically, two strategies (time-series and multi-refinement) were designed to address the challenges presented by heavy cloud cover over the sea. Three features documented in the OLI imagery time-series (contextual feature, and position- and size-invariance) were used to accurately discriminate offshore platforms from false positives. The AMEOP was applied to the Gulf of Thailand and 370 offshore platforms were automatically identified using 198 OLI images. Validation using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images and Chinese high-resolution satellite imagery demonstrated an omission error of 3.8% and a commission error below 1.0%. The AMEOP was also successfully extended to the Persian Gulf and northern Gulf of Mexico, 2346 and 2411 offshore platforms were respectively identified. We believe that the methodology presented herein provides a robust and cost-effective technique for improving the identification of offshore platforms over large areas of the sea; and that the accumulation of OLI data, together with the SAR images, has great potential for mapping and tracking of offshore platforms on a global scale, as well as for providing an early warning of oil spills around platforms and the improved estimation of their greenhouse gas emissions.

The associated algorithms were generally site specific or developed over a relatively narrow range of concentration, which make them inappropriate for global applications (or at least over broad SPM range). In the frame of the GlobCoast project, a large in situ data set of SPM and remote sensing reflectance, R-rs(lambda), has been built gathering together measurements from various coastal areas around Europe, French Guiana, North Canada, Vietnam, and China. This data set covers various contrasting coastal environments diversely affected by different biogeochemical and physical processes such as sediment resuspension, phytoplankton bloom events, and rivers discharges (Amazon, Mekong, Yellow river, MacKenzie, etc.). The SPM concentration spans about four orders of magnitude, from 0.15 to 2626 g center dot m(-3). Different empirical and semi-analytical approaches developed to assess SPM from R-rs(lambda) were tested over this in situ data set. As none of them provides satisfactory results over the whole SPM range, a generic semi-analytical approach has been developed. This algorithm is based on two standard semi-analytical equations calibrated for low-to-medium and highly turbid waters, respectively. A mixing law has also been developed for intermediate environments. Sources of uncertainties in SPM retrieval such as the bio-optical variability, atmospheric correction errors, and spectral bandwidth have been evaluated. The coefficients involved in these different algorithms have been calculated for ocean color (SeaWiFS, MODIS-A/T, MERIS/OLCI, VIIRS) and high spatial resolution (LandSat8-OLI, and Sentinel2-MSI) sensors. The performance of the proposed algorithm varies only slightly from one sensor to another demonstrating the great potential applicability of the proposed approach over global and contrasting coastal waters.

Geomorphological evolution of marine heads on the eastern coast of Red Sea at Saudi Arabian region, using remote sensing techniques	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												The eastern coast of the Red Sea is characterized by the presence of numerous marine heads that differ in terms of shape, size, geological setting, structures, and composition. This difference directly affects geomorphological evolution. In the present study, Ras Al-Shabaan was chosen as a most important area in this coast. Field investigations supported with photo-interpretation techniques were performed for studying of geomorphological features of Ras Al-Shabaan. On the other hand, the remotely sensed imagery data has been used extensively in the identification of geological and geomorphological details of Ras Al-Shabaan. The geomorphological studies showed that depositional processes of wadis and channels are predominant at the Ras Al-Shabaan coast. The changes in geomorphological and geological data of Ras Al-Shabaan were identified by remote sensing image software. Two Landsat ETM+ images from 1990 and 2010 have been processed. The analysis of remote sensing data combined with field investigations and reference data were used to monitor, delineate, and describe the geomorphological changes of Ras Al-Shabaan coast during proceedings of supervised classification of ground units. Hence, the change detection statistics have been used in ground units. Geological and geomorphological maps were digitized by using ArcGIS software. Remote sensing techniques and geographic information system (GIS) were employed in order to monitor the results of changes occurred in the line of the coast. The satellite image processing and water index data were transferred to the ArcGIS program to draw the coast lines and to stand on the changes occurred. Thereby, it was possible to identify the most prominent landforms and geomorphic units of this area. Results showed that platforms, barriers, rocky heads, islands, coral reefs, submerged reefs, tidal channels, dissolution grooves, sabkhas, inlet system, waves work, and shoreline processes were included in coastal prominent landforms. The circumstances that formed this coast are not permanent, as it is changing rapidly and continuously due to erosion and uplift processes.

Island coastal zones, which is a specific ecosystem surrounded by the sea, is more sensitive to human activities, e.g. reclamations. It is essential to monitor the dynamic changes of the island coastal areas to retrieve the siltation pattern of the surrounding open-sea and their impacts to island coastlines using remote sensing technique. In this paper, a time-series monitoring using Landsat images is performed to monitor the changes of a sand dam in the island coast zone, aiming at analyzing the effects of human exploitation. The results show great potential of using remote sensing images for coast zone dynamic monitoring.																	2153-6996		978-1-5090-3332-4				2016							2838	2841		10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7729733								WOS:000388114602227

To monitor the thermal pollution of cooling-water discharge from the coal-fired power plants and nuclear power plant in the eastern coastal region in China, the mono-window algorithm for retrieving sea surface temperature (SST) from thermal infrared bands of Landsat TM/ETM+, and HJ IRS data is improved by integrating the atmospheric correction model. The SST variability influenced by the thermal discharge from the coal-fired power plants and nuclear power plant near Xiangshan Harbour, Tianwan and Yueqing Bay in the eastern coastal area in China is investigated by comparing the distributions of SST around the power plants before and after the operation of the power plants. The results indicate that the spatial variability of SST rise depends on the installed capacity of power plants, coastal terrain, tide, etc. Although the area where the SST rise is more than 3. was not large, thermal discharge still exerts impact on ecosystems within the bay to some degree due to the relatively closeness of the environment of the bay. Taking the coastal terrain near the power plants into consideration, more reasonable operation projects of the power plants and the design of the intake and discharge mouth should be set up in order to accelerate the dilution, diffusion and cooling of the thermal plume under the influence of discharged flow of the rivers, and reduce the impact of thermal pollution on the ecological community with high biodiversity in the intertidal zone.																	2153-6996		978-1-5090-3332-4				2016							7659	7662		10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730997								WOS:000388114607117

Both IKO and Landsat TM data were preprocessed to calculate water depth invariant bands and the textural information was extracted from IKO data. Our results demonstrate that the IKO sensor produced a higher accuracy than the TM sensor in a three-class % SAV cover classification, and the overall accuracy of % SAV cover maps created with IKO data was 5-20% higher than these from other studies published. We also examined the spatial patterns of seagrass over a spatial range of 4-240 m using the Ripley's K function and IKO data that represented four different grain sizes (4 m, 8 m, 12 m, and 16 m) from seagrass cover. The Ripley's K metrics repeatedly show a dispersed (or slightly dispersed) pattern across 4-32 m and a random or slightly clustered pattern across 33-240 m. Therefore, use of the seagrass classification scheme introduced in the paper, along with data from the IKO sensor, offers an opportunity to synoptically record seagrass cover dynamics at both small and large spatial scales.																	2153-6996		978-1-5090-3332-4				2016							7663	7666		10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730998								WOS:000388114607118

MAPPING OF THE SEAGRASS COVER ALONG THE MEDITERRANEAN COAST OF TURKEY USING LANDSAT 8 OLI IMAGES	XXIII ISPRS CONGRESS, COMMISSION VIII	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				23rd Congress of the International-Society-for-Photogrammetry-and-Remote-Sensing (ISPRS)	JUL 12-19, 2016	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC	Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing				Benthic habitat is defined as ecological environment where marine animals, plants and other organisms live in. Benthic habitat mapping is defined as plotting the distribution and extent of habitats to create a map with complete coverage of the seabed showing distinct boundaries separating adjacent habitats or the use of spatially continuous environmental data sets to represent and predict biological patterns on the seafloor. Seagrass is an essential endemic marine species that prevents coast erosion and regulates carbon dioxide absorption in both undersea and atmosphere. Fishing, mining, pollution and other human activities cause serious damage to seabed ecosystems and reduce benthic biodiversity. According to the latest studies, only 5-10% of the seafloor is mapped, therefore it is not possible to manage resources effectively, protect ecologically important areas. In this study, it is aimed to map seagrass cover using Landsat 8 OLI images in the northern part of Mediterranean coast of Turkey. After pre-processing (e.g. radiometric, atmospheric, water depth correction) of Landsat images, coverage maps are produced with supervised classification using in-situ data which are underwater photos and videos. Result maps and accuracy assessment are presented and discussed.

FEASIBILITY STUDY OF LANDSAT-8 IMAGERY FOR RETRIEVING SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE (CASE STUDY PERSIAN GULF)	XXIII ISPRS CONGRESS, COMMISSION VIII	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				23rd Congress of the International-Society-for-Photogrammetry-and-Remote-Sensing (ISPRS)	JUL 12-19, 2016	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC	Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing				Sea surface temperature (SST) is one of the critical parameters in marine meteorology and oceanography. The SST datasets are incorporated as conditions for ocean and atmosphere models. The SST needs to be investigated for various scientific phenomenon such as salinity, potential fishing zone, sea level rise, upwelling, eddies, cyclone predictions. On the other hands, high spatial resolution SST maps can illustrate eddies and sea surface currents. Also, near real time producing of SST map is suitable for weather forecasting and fishery applications. Therefore satellite remote sensing with wide coverage of data acquisition capability can use as real time tools for producing SST dataset. Satellite sensor such as AVHRR, MODIS and SeaWIFS are capable of extracting brightness values at different thermal spectral bands. These brightness temperatures are the sole input for the SST retrieval algorithms. Recently, Landsat8 successfully launched and accessible with two instruments on-board: (1) the Operational Land Imager (OLI) with nine spectral bands in the visual, near infrared, and the shortwave infrared spectral regions; and (2) the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) with two spectral bands in the long wavelength infrared. The two TIRS bands were selected to enable the atmospheric correction of the thermal data using a split window algorithm (SWA). The TIRS instrument is one of the major payloads aboard this satellite which can observe the sea surface by using the split-window thermal infrared channels (CH10: 10.6 mu m to 11.2 mu m; CH11: 11.5 mu m to 12.5 mu m) at a resolution of 30 m. The TIRS sensors have three main advantages comparing with other previous sensors. First, the TIRS has two thermal bands in the atmospheric window that provide a new SST retrieval opportunity using the widely used split-window (SW) algorithm rather than the single channel method. Second, the spectral filters of TIRS two bands present narrower bandwidth than that of the thermal band on board on previous Landsat sensors. Third, TIRS is one of the best space born and high spatial resolution with 30 m. in this regards, Landsat-8 can use the Split-Window (SW) algorithm for retrieving SST dataset. Although several SWs have been developed to use with other sensors, some adaptations are required in order to implement them for the TIRS spectral bands. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to develop a SW, adapted for use with Landsat-8 TIRS data, along with its accuracy assessment. In this research, that has been done for modelling SST using thermal Landsat 8-imagery of the Persian Gulf. Therefore, by incorporating contemporary in situ data and SST map estimated from other sensors like MODIS, we examine our proposed method with coefficient of determination (R-2) and root mean square error (RMSE) on check point to model SST retrieval for Landsat-8 imagery. Extracted results for implementing different SW's clearly shows superiority of utilized method by R-2=0.95 and RMSE=0.24.																	2194-9034						2016	41	B8					1107	1110		10.5194/isprsarchives-XLI-B8-1107-2016								WOS:000393156000186

OCEAN COLOR RETRIEVAL USING LANDSAT-8 IMAGERY IN COASTAL CASE 2 WATERS (CASE STUDY PERSIAN AND OMAN GULF)	XXIII ISPRS CONGRESS, COMMISSION VIII	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				23rd Congress of the International-Society-for-Photogrammetry-and-Remote-Sensing (ISPRS)	JUL 12-19, 2016	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC	Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing				Ocean color (OC) monitoring using satellite imageries provides an appropriate tool for a better understanding of marine processes and changes in the coastal environment. Radiance measurements in the range of visible light of the electromagnetic spectrum provides information of ocean color that is associated with the water constituents. This measurements are used to monitor the level of biological activity and the presence of particles in the water. Ocean features such as the concentration of chlorophyll, suspended sediment concentration and sea surface temperature have a significant impact on the dynamics of the ocean. The concentration of chlorophyll (chla), active pigments of phytoplankton photosynthesis, as a key indicator applied for assessment of water quality and biochemistry. Experimental algorithms chla related to internal communication various optical components in the water that may be change in space and time in the water with different optical characteristics. Therefore, the algorithms have been developed for one area may not work for other places and each region according to its specific characteristics needs that determined by an algorithm may be appropriate to local. We have tried treatment several algorithms for determination of chlorophyll, including experimental algorithms with a simple band ratio of blue-green band (i.e. OCx) and algorithms includes two bands ratio with variable R-rs(lambda(2))/R-rs(lambda(1)), the three bands ratio with variable [R-rs(lambda(1))(-1)-R-rs(lambda(2))(-1)] x R-rs(lambda(3)) and four bands ratio with variable [R-rs(lambda(1))(-1)-R-rs(lambda(2))(-1)]/[R-rs(lambda(4))(-1)-R-rs(lambda(3))(-1)] that desired wavelength (i.e. lambda(1),lambda(2),lambda(3) and lambda(4)) in the range of red and near-infrared wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum are in the region of the Persian Gulf and Oman Sea look. Despite the high importance of the Persian Gulf and Oman Sea which can have up basin countries, to now few studies have been done in this area. The focus of this article on the northern part of Oman Sea and Persian Gulf, the shores of neighboring Iran (case 2 water). In this paper, by using Landsat 8 satellite imageries, we have discussed chla concentrations and customizing different OC algorithms for this new dataset (Landsat-8 imagery). This satellite was launched in 2013 and its data using two sensors continuously are provided operating one sensor imager land (OLI: Operational Land Imager) and the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS: Thermal InfraRed Sensor) and are available. This sensors collect image data, respectively, for the nine-band short wavelength in the range of 433-2300 nm and dual-band long wavelength thermal. Seven band of the nine band picked up by the sensor information of OLI to deal with sensors TM (Thematic Mapper) and ETM+ (Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus) in previous satellite Landsat compatible and two other band, the band of coastal water (433 to 453 nm) and Cirrus band (1360 to 1390 nm), short wave infrared provides to measure water quality and high thin clouds. Since OLI sensor in Landsat satellite 8 compared with other sensors to study OC have been allocated a much better spatial resolution can be more accurate to determine changes in OC. To evaluate the results of the image sensor MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) at the same time satellite images Landsat 8 is used. The statistical parameters used in order to evaluate the performance of different algorithms, including root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R-2), and on the basis of these parameters we choose the most appropriate algorithm for the area. Extracted results for implementing different OC algorithms clearly shows superiority of utilized method by R-2=0.71 and RMSE=0.07.

DETECTION OF COASTLINE DEFORMATION USING REMOTE SENSING AND GEODETIC SURVEYS	XXIII ISPRS CONGRESS, COMMISSION VIII	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				23rd Congress of the International-Society-for-Photogrammetry-and-Remote-Sensing (ISPRS)	JUL 12-19, 2016	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC	Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing				The coastal areas are being destroyed due to the usage that effect the natural balance. Unconsciously sand mining from the sea for nearshore nourishment and construction uses are the main ones. Physical interferences for mining of sand cause an ecologic threat to the coastal environment. However, use of marine sand is inevitable because of economic reasons or unobtainable land-based sand resources. The most convenient solution in such a protection-usage dilemma is to reduce negative impacts of sand production from marine. This depends on the accurate determination of criteriaon production place, style, and amount of sand. With this motivation, nearshore geodedic surveying studies performed on Kilyos Campus of Bogazici University located on the Black Sea coast, north of Istanbul, Turkey between 2001-2002. The study area extends 1 km in the longshore. Geodetic survey was carried out in the summer of 2001 to detect the initial condition for the shoreline. Long-term seasonal changes in shoreline positions were determined biannually. The coast was measured with post-processed kinematic GPS. Besides, shoreline change has studied using Landsat imagery between the years 1986-2015. The data set of Landsat 5 imageries were dated 05.08.1986 and 31.08.2007 and Landsat 7 imageries were dated 21.07.2001 and 28.07.2015. Landcover types in the study area were analyzed on the basis of pixel based classification method. Firstly, unsupervised classification based on ISODATA (Iterative Self Organizing Data Analysis Technique) has been applied and spectral clusters have been determined that gives prior knowledge about the study area. In the second step, supervised classification was carried out by using the three different approaches which are minimum-distance, parallelepiped and maximum-likelihood. All pixel based classification processes were performed with ENVI 4.8 image processing software. Results of geodetic studies and classification outputs will be presented in this paper.																	2194-9034						2016	41	B8					1169	1174		10.5194/isprsarchives-XLI-B8-1169-2016								WOS:000393156000198

These conditions play an important role in defining the diversity of life. The quantitative study of phenology is required to protect and make wise use of wetland and other coastal resources. We describe a low cost space-borne sensor and mission concept that will enable such studies using high quality, broad band hyperspectral observations of a wide range of habitats at Landsat-class spatial resolution and with a 3 day or better revisit rate, providing high signal to noise observations for aquatic scenes and consistent view geometry for wetland and terrestrial vegetation scenes.

Monitoring the dynamics of inland water bodies at a global scale is important for: (a) devising effective water management strategies, (b) assessing the impact of human actions on water security, (c) understanding the interplay between the spatio-temporal dynamics of surface water and climate change, and (d) near-real time mitigation and management of disaster events such as floods. Remote sensing datasets provide opportunities for global-scale monitoring of the extent or surface area of inland water bodies over time. We present a survey of existing remote sensing based approaches for monitoring the extent of inland water bodies and discuss their strengths and limitations. We further present an outline of the major challenges that need to be addressed for monitoring the extent and dynamics of water bodies at a global scale. Potential opportunities for overcoming some of these challenges are discussed using illustrative examples, laying the foundations for promising directions of future research in global monitoring of water dynamics.																	1860-949X		978-3-319-31858-5; 978-3-319-31856-1				2016	645						121	147		10.1007/978-3-319-31858-5_7	10.1007/978-3-319-31858-5							WOS:000387134900007

Ordovician shallow-marine tidal sandwaves in Algeria - the application of coeval outcrops to constrain the geometry and facies of a discontinuous, high-quality gas reservoir	VALUE OF OUTCROP STUDIES IN REDUCING SUBSURFACE UNCERTAINTY AND RISK IN HYDROCARBON EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION	Geological Society Special Publication											The Tiguentourine field in the Illizi Basin, Algeria, is a multi trillion cubic feet (TCF) gas accumulation, with production primarily from Late Ordovician proglacial density flow deposits with permeabilities typically in the range 100-0.1 mD. The proglacial succession is truncated by an erosive surface, above which a thin interval of shallow-marine sandstones with higher permeabilites is present in a few wells. These well-sorted, high-energy sandstones were, in turn, succeeded by Silurian-age graptolitic shales that form both the seal and the source rock. Although the shallow-marine sandstone is a high-quality reservoir interval, it is thin (< 12 m), discontinuous and not resolvable on seismic; it therefore represents a challenging target to predict. Coeval equivalents of the reservoir interval are exposed in the Tassili N'Ajjer, over 200 km south of the field. An erosive surface at the top of the proglacial sequence is succeeded by sandwaves with wavelengths of > 100 m. The geometries and facies relationships have been documented from Landsat and outcrops; they were then compared to modern marine settings. The varied facies and the localized absence of the shallow-marine unit at outcrop serve to explain why the better quality sandstone is variably developed in the subsurface and remains a high risk target.																	0305-8719		978-1-78620-140-9				2016	436						135	150		10.1144/SP436.11								WOS:000388097100007						
J	Wicaksono, P				Wicaksono, Pramaditya			Improving the accuracy of Multispectral-based benthic habitats mapping using image rotations: the application of Principle Component Analysis and Independent Component Analysis	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The low number of water penetration bands in multispectral images limits the maximum descriptive resolution and the accuracy of the resulting benthic habitats maps, especially at higher levels of benthic habitats scheme complexities. This research aimed at improving the accuracy of benthic habitats mapping by exploiting the spectral performance of multispectral images using image rotation techniques, which is very beneficial for fast, accurate, and repeatable mapping. Kemujan Island as part of the Karimunjawa archipelago in Indonesia is selected as the study area. Principle Component Analysis ( PCA) and Independent Component Analysis ( ICA) were applied on Worldview-2 prior to image classification. The inputs for PCA and ICA are deglint bands and water column-corrected bands. Field benthic data collected from photo-transect technique were used to train the rotated datasets in the classification process and to assess the accuracy of the resulting benthic habitat maps. Three levels of benthic habitats classification schemes were constructed based on the variation of benthic habitats insitu, which covers the variations of coral reefs, seagrass, macro algae, and bare substratum. The results show that the application of image rotations on Worldview-2 improves the overall accuracy of benthic habitats mapping and become more effective as the classification scheme complexities increase. In the absence of water column correction, PCA and ICA become the best option to assist benthic habitats mapping.

Satellite based sensors provide a repetitive and synoptic coverage of inaccessible/larger areas which generated a time series database useful in identification and mapping of environment and resources. These databases form a scientific tool for various stakeholders to device suitable strategies for management of coastal and marine resources. This chapter analyses the various applications of satellite remote sensing and numerical modelling on identification and mapping of mangroves, coral reefs, fishing and molluscan grounds in the coastal marine ecosystems with relevant case studies and illustrations. The mapping methods for mangroves explains the classification protocols, advantages in using different remote sensing techniques and the comparison of different mapping techniques. In case of reef mapping, the vulnerability mapping of reefs due to extreme events is also discussed. Fish movement in a dynamic environment and the mapping of these movements with the help of proxy indicators are also detailed. Molluscan mapping is done based on the biomass differences during different seasons and their physical attributes.																	2211-0577		978-3-319-25121-9; 978-3-319-25119-6				2016	13						105	123		10.1007/978-3-319-25121-9_4	10.1007/978-3-319-25121-9							WOS:000376129800005

To focus on key elements of bio-diversity typically existing in tropical islands the detection of corals, seagrass, and mangrove forests was addressed. Satellite data were acquired from Landsat-8; for the purpose of validation Rapid-Eye data were also used. In situ data supporting image processing were collected in a field campaign performed from 28 February to 4 March 2015 at the time of sensors overpasses. A hybrid approach based on bio-optical modeling and supervised classification techniques was applied to atmospherically-corrected Landsat-8 data. Bottom depth estimations, to be used in the classification process of shallow waters, were in good agreement with depth soundings (R-2 = 0.87). Corals were classified with producer and user accuracies of 58% and 77%, while a lower accuracy (producer and user accuracies of 50%) was found for the seagrass due to the patchy distribution of meadows; accuracies more than 88% were obtained for mangrove forests. The classification indicated the presence of 18 mangroves sites with extension larger than 5 km(2); for 15 of those the coexistence of corals and seagrass were also found in the fronting bays, suggesting a significant rate of biodiversity for the study area.

Classification of Continental Shelves in Terms of Geospatially Integrated Physiographic Realms and Morphodynamic Zones	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												The continental shelf off southeast Florida contains a range of benthic environments that are discernible via remote sensing platforms because of low turbidity in the water column. Using the Geospatially Integrated Seafloor Classification Scheme (G-ISCS), physiographic realms and associated morphodynamic zones were cognitively interpreted and classified at a nominal scale of 1:6000 across four remote sensing platforms (i.e. GeoEye IKONOS-2, Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper UK, Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper [ETM], and National Agriculture Imagery Program [NAIP] high-resolution aerial orthoimagery). Attribute tables were created in conjunction with interpretations to quantify and compare spatial relationships between classificatory units and the different remote sensing platforms. Resultant maps exported from ESRI ArcGIS (R) ArcMap software showed that while IKONOS-2 satellite imagery and NAIP aerial orthoimagery provided the greatest detail, classification of physiographic realms and morphodynamic zones was still possible using TM and ETM satellite images. Overall, it was determined that IKONOS-2 provided the most beneficial imagery when applying such a classification of coastal and seafloor features. It is postulated that accurate delineation of physiographic realms and morphodynamic zones can provide a foundation for more in-depth biogeomorpholocial classification (e.g., further subdivision into benthic geoforms, coastal landforms, biological cover) along continental shelves.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				JAN	2016	32	1					1	34		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-15A-00003.1								WOS:000368221800001

Although it is known that a large portion of the released oil from this second largest accidental marine oil spill in history reached the surface, to date there has been no attempt to document the surface footprint and trajectory of the released oil. Our study attempts to fill this knowledge gap using remote sensing data collected by Landsat/MSS and CZCS. Both showed the same general patterns of oil trajectory to the northwest and north, nearly parallel to the coastline of the western Gulf of Mexico (GoM) with possible oil landing on Mexican and Texas beaches. Field observations at selected beaches and islands along the coast of the western and southern GoM during and after the spill confirmed these satellite-based findings, which were also used to help in planning a recent field campaign to collect sediment samples in the southern GoM.

J	Saul, S; Purkis, S				Saul, Steven; Purkis, Sam			Semi-Automated Object-Based Classification of Coral Reef Habitat using Discrete Choice Models	REMOTE SENSING												As for terrestrial remote sensing, pixel-based classifiers have traditionally been used to map coral reef habitats. For pixel-based classifiers, habitat assignment is based on the spectral or textural properties of each individual pixel in the scene. More recently, however, object-based classifications, those based on information from a set of contiguous pixels with similar properties, have found favor with the reef mapping community and are starting to be extensively deployed. Object-based classifiers have an advantage over pixel-based in that they are less compromised by the inevitable inhomogeneity in per-pixel spectral response caused, primarily, by variations in water depth. One aspect of the object-based classification workflow is the assignment of each image object to a habitat class on the basis of its spectral, textural, or geometric properties. While a skilled image interpreter can achieve this task accurately through manual editing, full or partial automation is desirable for large-scale reef mapping projects of the magnitude which are useful for marine spatial planning. To this end, this paper trials the use of multinomial logistic discrete choice models to classify coral reef habitats identified through object-based segmentation of satellite imagery. Our results suggest that these models can attain assignment accuracies of about 85%, while also reducing the time needed to produce the map, as compared to manual methods. Limitations of this approach include misclassification of image objects at the interface between some habitat types due to the soft gradation in nature between habitats, the robustness of the segmentation algorithm used, and the selection of a strong training dataset. Finally, due to the probabilistic nature of multinomial logistic models, the analyst can estimate a map of uncertainty associated with the habitat classifications. Quantifying uncertainty is important to the end-user when developing marine spatial planning scenarios and populating spatial models from reef habitat maps.																	2072-4292					DEC	2015	7	12					15894	15916		10.3390/rs71215810								WOS:000367534000005

Sediment plumes induced by the Port of Miami dredging: Analysis and interpretation using Landsat and MODIS data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Beginning in November 2013, large turbidity plumes were observed offshore the Port of Miami (Florida, USA), likely associated with a project to deepen and widen the Miami Harbor channels. Local coral colonies, including those considered threatened by the US Endangered Species Act, exacerbate the need for thorough assessment of these plumes. Without ruling out other causal factors such as wind storms and tidal currents, it is difficult to conclude whether the plumes were caused by the dredging. From current in situ monitoring programs, it is also difficult to estimate the size, duration, extent and historical context of these plumes. Satellite observing systems, in contrast, offer a means by which these plumes can be monitored and compared to previous events. As such, turbidity plumes visible in Landsat 8 and MODE Aqua imagery were first manually outlined, and then refined (for MODIS only) using anomaly and normalized anomaly thresholds determined from pre-dredging data. Local environmental conditions were also considered and used to determine dates for which elevated reflectance data might be expected in the absence of dredging. In total, the spatial extent of all turbidity plumes observed from November 2013 to April 2015 was between 127 and 228 km(2), at least 5 times that for January October 2013. Furthermore, the frequency of observed plumes in images increased from 23% to 84% after dredging began. Coral areas were particularly affected after dredging began, with over 11 km(2) of coral area being within plumes on an average of 16% of images (maximum 39%). Temporal differences in location, severity, and size were also observed. Together, these results highlight widespread turbidity plumes associated with the Port of Miami dredging activities, which may cause large adverse effects on local coral communities. The approaches developed in this work, in particular the focus on historical norms after considering all perturbation factors, may be included in monitoring and assessment of this and future dredging activities, especially where fragile marine ecosystems may be impacted.

A processing system to monitor Greenland outlet glacier velocity variations at decadal and seasonal time scales utilizing the Landsat imagery	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												In this paper we present a monitoring system for area-wide flow-velocity fields of the outlet glaciers of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) utilizing the freely available Landsat archive. In order to process this large amount of satellite images an almost automatic monitoring system was developed. With the Global Digital Elevation Map V2 (GDEM-V2) of the Advanced Spacebome Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) an improved orthorectification was applied which, in combination with a destriping correction of the Landsat 7 products with Scan Line Corrector (SLC) failure, leads to more precise flow-velocity information. In addition, outliers were removed using an adaptive, recursive filter approach. For the time span 1972-2012 more than 100,000 flow-velocity fields were derived from over 16,000 optical multi-sensoral Landsat scenes (Landsat 1 to Landsat 7) allowing the determination of the long-term flow-velocity trend. Moreover, the high temporal resolution facilitates the analysis of seasonal flow-velocity variations of numerous outlet glaciers. For many of the major outlet glaciers the results show an acceleration pattern that is consistent with most of the previously published analyses. However, the flow-velocity changes do not have a uniform pattern in their temporal and spatial distribution. This study provides both a high temporal densification and an extension of existing flow-velocity information of the GrIS margin. Finally, this processing chain in its generality allows for the determination of various types of surface displacements and can be applied to other glacier regions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This study analyzed the wetlands in Shanghai, a province-level city, using remote sensing, image processing, and geographic information systems (GIS) techniques based on the Chinese national wetland inventory procedure and standards. FORMOSAT imagery acquired in 2012 and Navy nautical charts of the Yangtze estuarine area were used in conjunction with object-oriented segmentation, expert interpretation, and field validation to determine wetland status. Landsat imagery from 1985, 1995, 2000, 2003 and 2013 as well as social-economic data collected from 1985 to 2013 were used to further assess wetland changes. In 2013, Shanghai contained 376970.6 ha of wetlands, and 78.8% of all wetlands were in marine or estuarine systems. Estuarine waters comprised the single largest wetland category. Between the first national wetland inventory in 2003 and the second national wetland inventory in 2013, Shanghai lost 50519.1 ha of wetlands, amounting to a mean annual loss rate of 1.2% or an 11.8% loss over the decade. Declines were proportionately higher in marine and estuarine wetlands, with an annual loss of 1.8%, while there was a sharp increase of 1882.6% in constructed water storage areas for human uses. Diking, filling, impoundment and reclamation, which are all attributable to the economic development and urbanization associated with population increases, were the major factors that explained the gain and loss of wetlands. Additional factors affecting wetland losses and gains include sediment trapping by the hydropower system, which reduces supply to the estuary and erodes wetlands, and sediment trapping by the jetties, spur dikes, and diversion bulwark associated with a navigation channel deepening project, which has the converse effect, increasing saltmarsh wetland area at Jiuduansha shoal by three times between 2000 and 2013.

Seasonal Variation of Colored Dissolved Organic Matter in Barataria Bay, Louisiana, Using Combined Landsat and Field Data	REMOTE SENSING												Coastal bays, such as Barataria Bay, are important transition zones between the terrigenous and marine environments that are also optically complex due to elevated amounts of particulate and dissolved constituents. Monthly field data collected over a period of 15 months in 2010 and 2011 in Barataria Bay were used to develop an empirical band ratio algorithm for the Landsat-5 TM that showed a good correlation with the Colored Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM) absorption coefficient at 355 nm (a(g)355) (R-2 = 0.74). Landsat-derived CDOM maps generally captured the major details of CDOM distribution and seasonal influences, suggesting the potential use of Landsat imagery to monitor biogeochemistry in coastal water environments. An investigation of the seasonal variation in a(g)355 conducted using Landsat-derived a(g)355 as well as field data suggested the strong influence of seasonality in the different regions of the bay with the marine end members (lower bay) experiencing generally low but highly variable a(g)355 and the freshwater end members (upper bay) experiencing high a(g)355 with low variability. Barataria Bay experienced a significant increase in a(g)355 during the freshwater release at the Davis Pond Freshwater Diversion (DPFD) following the Deep Water Horizon oil spill in 2010 and following the Mississippi River (MR) flood conditions in 2011, resulting in a weak linkage to salinity in comparison to the other seasons. Tree based statistical analysis showed the influence of high river flow conditions, high- and low-pressure systems that appeared to control a(g)355 by 28%, 29% and 43% of the time duration over the study period at the marine end member just outside the bay. An analysis of CDOM variability in 2010 revealed the strong influence of the MR in controlling CDOM abundance in the lower bay during the high flow conditions, while strong winds associated with cold fronts significantly increase CDOM abundance in the upper bay, thus revealing the important role these events play in the CDOM dynamics of the bay.

Hydrosalinity and environmental land degradation assessment of the East Nile Delta region, Egypt	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION												Environmental land degradation is a major impediment to the utilization of land in many arid and semi-arid regions of the World and is a major issue in the East Nile Delta (END), Egypt. Waterlogging and salt-affected soil problems have serious implications for irrigated areas leading to socio-economic and agricultural development problems. In the present study, timely and accurate detection of land degradation through remote sensing and hydrosalinity indicators, along with their characteristics and severity classification in a GIS environment, has been undertaken to provide, determine, assess and map reliable geo-information of environmental land degradation. This research deals with an assessment of hydrosalinity and environmental land degradation based on some new, but simple and practical, approaches for assessing salinity and spread of land degradation through digital image processing, geo-statistics and geochemistry. This analysis utilises Landsat 8, ASTER GDEM data, hydrochemical and statistical analyses using a GIS, together with other field collected data sets for the same date of May 2014. The hydrosalinity mapping and the statistical data analysis of TDS, major ions, groundwater grouping and hydrochemical facies and also water table maps between 1994 and 2014 reveals that the main sources of groundwater recharge and water bodies are mostly attributed to the continuous seepage from newly cultivated lands. The new flow regime is the main contributing factor to the rising water level, water salinity and waterlogging problems. Moreover, the spatial distribution of major ion content could be attributed to the leaching of aquifer materials along the flow path (Na, Ca, and Cl), the study area affected by agricultural pollution (Mg and SO4) and the leaching process which acts on the easily soluble evaporate-rich fluvio-marine sediments of a shallow aquifer (NO3 and PO4). The spatial distribution maps of the physico-chemical properties of soil such as EC, pH, SAR, Na, Cl, SO4 and Ca are compared with remote sensing salinity indices and then integrated to classify and map the salinity and salt-affected soil by using GIS tools. These indicate that increases in soil salinity levels pose a serious threat to sustainable agricultural developments that requires special attention to maintain an appropriate soil-water plant relationship by providing an adequate drainage system. The identification of land degradation mitigation measures requires thorough knowledge of the ground and surface water, human activities, and the salinity dynamics of the study area.

Here, we (1) review the current status of the diversity and distribution of coastal ecosystems in BCS, (2) assess the composition and coverage of these ecosystems in PNAs, and (3) identify coastal ecosystems of special interest for conservation. The combination of spatial analysis techniques was carried out using LandSat TM images and GIS processing, considering ecoregions and ecosystems in the coastal zone, as well as through the application of an ecosystem diversity index. In the BCS coastal zone, 11 ecosystems were identified: scrub, coastal water body, riparian, bare soil, halophyte, beach, salt flat, mangrove, salt marsh, coral reef, and seagrass. The ecosystem diversity in BCS results from the coastal features that differentiate the Pacific and the Gulf coasts. PNAs include 17 % of coastal ecosystems. Bahia Magdalena (Pacific) and Bahia Concepcin (Gulf of California), which are key for conservation (including mangroves and seagrasses), should be considered either for classification as PNAs or for inclusion in coastal management programs. The combination of remote sensing and GIS with biogeographic and ecosystemic approaches in our study enabled to determine ecosystem diversity and set coastal conservation priorities in Baja California Sur, Mexico. Specifically, coastal ecosystems that are not currently included within PNAs and which should be considered as conservation priorities were identified.																	1400-0350	1874-7841				AUG	2015	19	4					609	619		10.1007/s11852-015-0411-y								WOS:000362017900015

Extensive retreat of Greenland tidewater glaciers, 2000-2010	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Overall mass loss from the Greenland ice sheet nearly doubled during the early 2000s resulting in an increased contribution to sea-level rise, with this step-change being mainly attributed to the widespread frontal retreat and accompanying dynamic thinning of tidewater glaciers. Changes in glacier calving-front positions are easily derived from remotely sensed imagery and provide a record of dynamic change. However, ice-sheet-wide studies of calving fronts have been either spatially or temporally limited. In this study multiple calving-front positions were derived for 199 Greenland marine-terminating outlet glaciers with width greater than 1 km using Landsat imagery for the 11-year period 2000-2010 in order to identify regional seasonal and inter-annual variations. During this period, outlet glaciers were characterized by sustained and substantial retreat summing to more than 267 km, with only 11 glaciers showing overall advance. In general, the pattern of mass loss detected by GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) and other measurements is reflected in the calving record of Greenland glaciers. Our results suggest several regions in the south and east of the ice sheet likely share controls on their dynamic changes, but no simple single control is apparent.

Furthermore, coral reefs are very valuable as a socioeconomic resource as they make important contributions to the gross domestic product of many countries. Thus, it is very important to monitor dynamic spatial distributions of coral reefs and related habitats dominated by coral rubble, dead coral, and bleached corals. Despite these natural and socio-economic advantages, many factors are threatening coral reefs. The study site was selected in Spermonde archipelago, South Sulawesi, Indonesia because this area is included in the Coral Triangle, recognized as the epicenter of coral diversity and a priority for conservation. Images of Landsat MSS, Landsat TM, Landsat ETM, Landsat ETM+, and Landsat 8 data were used to examine changes in the coral reefs of Suranti Island in the Spermonde Archipelago during forty one years from 1972 to 2013. The image processing includes gap fills, atmospheric corrections, geometric corrections, image composites, water column corrections, unsupervised classifications, and reclassifications. Fill Gap processing was done on Landsat ETM+ SLC-off. Subsequently, a multi-component change detection procedure was applied to define changes. Shallow water bottom types classification was divided into live coral, rubble and sand habitats, dead coral with algae, rubble, and sand. Preliminary results showed significant changes during the period 1972-2013 as well as changes in coral reefs, likely explained partly by destructive fishing practices.																	1738-5261	2005-7172				JUN	2015	50	2					317	325		10.1007/s12601-015-0029-x								WOS:000357691000020

Supervised Classification of Benthic Reflectance in Shallow Subtropical Waters Using a Generalized Pixel-Based Classifier across a Time Series	REMOTE SENSING												We tested a supervised classification approach with Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) data for time-series mapping of seagrass in a subtropical lagoon. Seagrass meadows are an integral link between marine and inland ecosystems and are at risk from upstream processes such as runoff and erosion. Despite the prevalence of image-specific approaches, the classification accuracies we achieved show that pixel-based spectral classes may be generalized and applied to a time series of images that were not included in the classifier training. We employed in-situ data on seagrass abundance from 2007 to 2011 to train and validate a classification model. We created depth-invariant bands from TM bands 1, 2, and 3 to correct for variations in water column depth prior to building the classification model. In-situ data showed mean total seagrass cover remained relatively stable over the study area and period, with seagrass cover generally denser in the west than the east. Our approach achieved mapping accuracies (67% and 76% for two validation years) comparable with those attained using spectral libraries, but was simpler to implement. We produced a series of annual maps illustrating inter-annual variability in seagrass occurrence. Accuracies may be improved in future work by better addressing the spatial mismatch between pixel size of remotely sensed data and footprint of field data and by employing atmospheric correction techniques that normalize reflectances across images.

J	Vanhellemont, Q; Ruddick, K				Vanhellemont, Quinten; Ruddick, Kevin			Advantages of high quality SWIR bands for ocean colour processing: Examples from Landsat-8	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Monitoring of water quality by satellite ocean colour data requires high quality atmospheric correction and especially the accurate quantification of the aerosol contribution to the top of atmosphere radiance. Several methods have been proposed for atmospheric correction over turbid waters, including modelling the marine contributions to the NIR signal or switching to longer short-wave infrared (SWIR) wavelengths where the signal even in turbid waters can be assumed zero. Here we present the use of the high quality SWIR bands of the Operational Land Imager (OLI) on Landsat-8, launched in 2013, to extend our existing turbid water atmospheric correction to extremely turbid waters. The atmospheric correction is image based, and no external measurements are required. The aerosol type is estimated using NIR and SWIR bands in clear water pixels, or in all water pixels using the two SWIR bands. The aerosol type is assumed to be constant over a single Landsat-8 tile (170 by 185 km), or allowed to vary spatially when using both SWIR bands. Realistic spatial patterns of marine reflectances are retrieved, uncorrelated with the estimated aerosol reflectance. Taking spatial and temporal variability into account, products from Landsat-8 compare well with those of MODIS Aqua and Terra also using the SWIR bands for atmospheric correction. The limitations of our previously published method (Vanhellemont & Ruddick, 2014a) are illustrated at higher turbidities, and removed by using the new method. The uncertainty caused by using a single aerosol type per scene is assessed. The advantages of the high spatial resolution L8/OLI data are clear for applications in coastal and estuarine waters. As an example of the advantage of high quality SWIR bands, and a SWIR-based atmospheric correction, an algorithm for detecting black suspended sediments from dredging and dumping operations is demonstrated here. In conclusion, L8/OLI is a powerful new tool for remote sensing of extremely turbid waters, and can be used as a precursor for future ocean colour missions with SWIR bands. (C) 2015 The Authors.

One of the most important water quality parameters that can be assessed in coastal waters and river estuaries using remote sensing techniques is suspended sediment concentration (SSC). It regulates primary production and has substantial influence on the migration of pollutants, temperature, and marine life. In this study, Moderate-Resolution Imagine Spectrometry (MODIS) images were used to retrieve the SSC along the southern coast of the Caspian Sea. MODIS of 250 m resolution data were utilized because they have the highest spatial resolution of all the MODIS bands. In situ data were gathered with multiple campaigns with fast motor boats, while the MODIS sensor was passing over the study area. The goal of this article is to apply artificial neural networks (ANN) to retrieve SSC from satellite remote sensing imagery. ANN function as an intelligent structure to model a variety of nonlinear relationships because iteration-based inversion methods need long computation times for common usage. Using a validation data set and a testing data set, the network could be validated. The learning process was more efficient which resulted in a shorter learning time. The validation data set played a vital role as a stopping criterion during the training procedure to overcome the overtraining problem. A robust relationship between MODIS bands 1 and 2 and in situ data was established based on a three-layer ANN with six neurons in the hidden layer. Root mean squared error and R-2 values for this model were 0.853 and 0.969 mg/L, respectively, for all data. Results of this study reveal that the SSC in the Caspian Sea gradually decreases from west to east.

J	Zheng, YM; Niu, ZG; Gong, P; Wang, J				Zheng, Yaomin; Niu, Zhenguo; Gong, Peng; Wang, Jie			A database of global wetland validation samples for wetland mapping	SCIENCE BULLETIN												A database of global wetland validation samples (GWVS) is the foundation for wetland mapping on a global scale. In this work, a database of GWVS was created based on 25 "wetland-related" keyword searches of a total of 3,506 full-text documents downloaded from the Web of Science. Eight hundred and three samples from a total of 68 countries and 141 protected areas were recorded by the GWVS, including samples of marine/coastal wetlands, inland wetlands and human-made wetlands, at ratios of 53 %, 41 % and 6 %, respectively. The results exhibit spatial distribution among Terrestrial Ecoregions of the World, the World Database on Protected Areas and the Database of Global Administrative Areas. Within most of the biomes, protected areas and countries examined, the very low concentration of samples requires more attention in the future. The greatest concentration of samples within a single biome is found in the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forest biome, accounting for 27 % of the total samples, while no sample is found in the biome of tropical and subtropical coniferous woodland. Greater efforts are expected to be made to record samples in Oceania, Central Europe, Northern Europe, Northern Africa, Central Africa, Central America, the Caribbean, and midwestern South America. Our data show that it is feasible to map global wetlands using Landsat TM/ETM+ at 30-m resolution. The continued improvement of the GWVS sharing platform should be reinforced in the future, making a strong contribution to global wetland mapping and monitoring.																	2095-9273	2095-9281				FEB	2015	60	4					428	434		10.1007/s11434-014-0717-4								WOS:000349615700003

In order to simulate LAPAN-A3/IPB line imager data acquisition using high data rate modulator and demodulator (HDRM), it is required two independent simulation program. The background behind that was the data rate constraint. It took a large amount of CPU resources to simulate 105 Mbps CCSDS packet data formation. So the simulation was divided into two parts, the first part will simulate the 5 mbps CCSDS packet data formation and the second will simulate the 105 mbps pseudo random binary sequence (PRBS). This four channel payload of R,G,B and Ni system of LAPAN-A3/IPB satellite is quite similar with Landsat camera standard as an earth observation satellite. This paper will describe about the modulation and demodulation simulation process of the LAPAN-A3/IPB satellite data image by using HDRM. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The time lapse between samplings was 26 and 32 years. Beach profiles, shoreline changes, textural parameters and composition of surficial beach sands from the foreshore were compared. This study considers the state of tide, rainfall and meteorological events. A total of 23 beach locations were studied: 19 for the Southern Gulf of Mexico and 4 for the Riviera Maya. The beach profiles show variations, with recent beaches sometimes being wider than the ancient ones. The concavity of the recent exposed beach profiles suggests that many of them are eroding. The coastline contours were analyzed through LANDSAT images from several years. Variations of coastlines in different years suggest the influence of anthropogenic and meteorological processes, indicating a connection between deposition and erosion of beaches at locations that are not very far from each other. The comparisons of textural and compositional parameters proved to be useful in the comparative analysis of ancient and recent beach sands. It is noted that it is more common for recent sediments to be more poorly sorted compared to ancient sediments, which may suggest greater interference of anthropogenic factors in recent sediments or a greater variation in oceanographic parameters. The greater statistical weight is observed through principal component analysis and is given by heavy minerals in terrigenous sands, and in carbonate sediments by pellets; this relation reflects favorable conditions for erosion and a probable depletion of marine littoral organisms and birds.																	1405-3322						2015	67	1					21	43										WOS:000353905400003

Evaluation of coastal erosion and accretion processes along the southwest coast of Kanyakumari, Tamil Nadu using geospatial techniques	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												The impact of coastal erosion has adversely affected the socioeconomic conditions of the coastal community worldwide. The coastal environment is experiencing a wide range of natural and anthropogenic pressure in India. This study was carried out along the southwest coast of Kanyakumari, South India using multitemporal Landsat satellite images from 1999 to 2011. The long-term coastal erosion and accretion rates have been calculated for the periods between 1999 and 2011, and the subsequent short-term changes were performed during 1999-2000, 2005-2006, and 2010-2011. Thus, the long-term coastal changes indicate that the net erosion rate is higher on the coasts of Kanyakumari, Kovalam, Manavalakurichi, Mandaikadu, and Thengapattinam; the values are 0.118, 0.105, 0.127, 0.133, and 0.017 m(2), respectively. Meanwhile, the annual erosion rate of these areas is 10,000, 9,000, 11,000, and 1000 m(2)/year. The coastal zones Ganapathipuram and Enayamputhandurai have experienced accretion; the net accretion rate is 0.271 and 0.081 m(2), respectively. Coastal beaches, beach ridges, and marine terraces are predominantly disturbed by the hydrodynamic processes including wave action, littoral current, and intervention of littoral drift by the artificial coastal structures like groins, revetments, and seawalls. Moreover, the study area has been demarcated with site-specific erosion and accretion zones based on the frequent seaward or landward coastline fluctuation through geospatial technique.

Using the unique spectral signature of guano to identify unknown seabird colonies	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Despite the threats faced by seabirds in both terrestrial and marine habitats, even basic knowledge of the locations of colonies, population sizes and trends is lacking for many remote areas of the world. Recent studies have shown that the guano of Adelie penguins can be identified from Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) imagery and used to map colonies on coasts around continental Antarctica. Our study highlights a new technique based on the unique spectral signature of guano that can be used to discriminate seabird colonies from background geology and vegetation in a wider range of natural environments, including the vegetated and zoologically-diverse region of the Antarctic Peninsula; moreover, the method was effective for all densely colonial, surface-nesting seabirds. Using Landsat ETM imagery, we correctly identified all known seabird colonies of over 50 pairs in the area of Marguerite Bay. Almost all other areas with a similar spectral signature that were outside known breeding areas were single pixels that were readily distinguishable from genuine colonies. If these were excluded, only 4.1% of pixels appeared to represent unknown breeding or roosting sites, and warrant further investigation. The spatial extent of the guano provided a general guide to the number of individuals present, but further work would be required to determine the accuracy of this method for estimating population size. Spectral profiles of guano collected by satellite and hand-held spectrometers were compared with available data in spectral libraries and did not match with any known geological profile. There may also be potential for discriminating colonies of different species that differ in phenology and show seasonal changes in diet by the carefully-timed acquisition of suitable satellite imagery. We conclude that the remotely-sensed guano signature is a good indicator of the location of seabird breeding or roosting sites, with potentially wide application to other areas of the world.

Reclamation activities bring economic benefits and at the same time also bring great threat for offshore resources and coastal wetland ecosystem. At the end of the river, estuarine delta is a dynamic balancing system formed by the interaction of the hydrological process of river, sea and land. Because of its geographical position superiority, estuarine deltas often become populated areas of reclamation activity. Time-series remote sensing data, such as LANDSAT data hold considerable promise for investigating long-term dynamics of land use/cover change (LUCC), given their significant advantages of frequent temporal coverage and free cost. In this paper, through the support vector machine automatic interpretation method, the LUCC information for Liaohe estuary wetland from 1987 to 2014 was obtained using the LANDSAT images as the data source. Systems analysis of dynamic evolution characteristics was implemented for reclamation and land cover types in Liaohe wetland ecosystem. The reclamation estimation on the wetland ecosystem service function value loss was established, and the driving effect of reclamation on the evolution of wetland research was considered. Results show that ( 1) rapid growth for sea aquaculture and reclamation in 1987-1989 and the process slowed down in 1989-2000. Later during the period 2004-2014, the area of sea reclamation project increased rapidly (2) Liaohe estuarine wetland had been subject to much change. This resulted from direct and indirect impacts of the project of reclamation and marine aquaculture. The ecosystem service value was response to the wetland land use/cover changes. So it was concluded that the LUCC information can provide a reference for both ecological restoration and compensation funds after the formation of reclamation and effective wetland protection measures are needed informed by the change analysis.																			978-90-824846-0-1				2015							76	86										WOS:000398996200012

Compared to Landsat heritage sensors, the OLI has enhanced features, which include its 12-bit radiometric resolution and the addition of a band centered at 443 nm. The dramatically improved data quality/quantity expands existing applications of Landsat imagery in aquatic sciences from the retrieval of bio-geochemical properties, such as near-surface concentrations of chlorophyll-a (CHL) and total suspended solids (TSS), to benthic mapping. This study offers analysis of OLI's absolute radiometric performance over bodies of water using benchmark observations, namely the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) ocean color observations and marine in situ radiometric measurements. Sensor-to-sensor comparisons are performed to derive gain factors (g(1)) from near-concurrent observations in TOA radiance and reflectance domains. The gains in the radiance domain were further validated/adjusted by determining a second set of gains (g(2)) via analysis of OLI-derived water-leaving radiance, i.e., L-w(lambda), against in situ measurements made either at the Ocean Color AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET-OC) sites or during field campaigns. The analyses yield the OLI calibration uncertainties that need to be accounted for when studying aquatic environments. It was found that, for the visible and near-infrared channels, the OLI radiometric responses, on average, are well in agreement (< 2 % discrepancies) with the TOA radiances estimated by ocean color satellites or those predicted by models based on measurements of aquatic and atmospheric properties. However, the TOA radiance at the new 443-nm band is found to be, on average, 3.4 % larger than the reference observations. The inter-sensor comparisons in the reflectance domain, however, indicated slightly different results with the OLI responses being low in the blue bands. To enhance the retrieval accuracy of aquatic-science products from OLI datasets, sets of temporally averaged gains (radiance and reflectance) are derived and recommended for use prior to the retrieval of in-water products.

Average water depths on the platform-tops, such as the Great Bahama Bank (GBB), are typically 10 m or less, with coral reef-rimmed margins, thick sediment accumulations, and the frequent occurrence of islands. There are, however, exceptions. For example, Cay Sal Bank (CSB), a little studied detached Bahamian carbonate platform with depths ranging from 30 to 7 m, is only slightly deeper than the GBB, but devoid of islands, lacks platform-margin coral reefs and holds little sediment on the platform-top; the platform is incipiently drowned. CSB is interesting as it is conspicuously larger (6000 sq. km) than other incipiently drowned platforms in the region, such as Serranilla Bank (1100 sq. km) and the Cat Island platform (1500 sq. km). Field and remote sensing data are assembled to provide insight into the sedimentology and geomorphology of the CSB. The influence of ocean climate, regional hydrodynamics, and Holocene flooding history are investigated to understand why platform-margin coral reef growth on CSB has been unable to keep pace with Holocene sea-level rise. A decade of regional sea-surface temperature data for the Bahamas report CSB to be situated in the same ocean climate regime as GBB. Temperature cannot explain the platform's different morphologies. The Florida Current has been evoked as a possible reason for the immature development of platform-top processes on the CSB, but numeric modeling suggests its influence to be restricted to the deep flanks of the bank. Further, sediment distribution on CSB, including infill patterns of karst depressions, suggest trade winds (easterlies) to drive platform-top hydrodynamics. By assembling a satellite-derived bathymetry map, it can be shown that CSB flooded earlier and at relatively higher rates of Holocene sea-level rise than its neighboring platforms. Flooding history is identified as the most feasible explanation for the atypical morphology of the CSB. By contrasting the present-day morphology of the CSB and the GBB, the work emphasizes how subtle differences in relative sea-level history can influence the growth of platform-margin coral reefs, features that in turn can conspire to set even closely neighboring carbonate platforms on divergent paths with regard to the development of marine landforms. This insight is relevant to interpreting the morphological diversity of carbonate platforms in the modem ocean and in the rock record. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Palacio-Aponte, G				Palacio-Aponte, Gerardo			Land cover modification geoindicator applied in a tropical coastal environment	REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL												Environmental changes due to natural processes and anthropic modifications can be characterized by the degree of land cover modification and its environmental implications overtime. The main goal of the present study was to propose and apply a land cover modification geoindicator in order to assess the environmental condition of the territory per landscape units. It was designed to interpret diffuse information and transform it into a synthetic indicator that will be useful for environmental managers. The geoindicator evaluation was performed through a multi-temporal analysis of medium resolution Landsat satellite images and their unsupervised classification according to the direction of land use transitions. A change detection analysis between image pairs from 1973, 1991 and 2001 was made to detect unaffected areas and the areas in which positive or negative land cover changes could be observed. The proposed methodology was applied in the coastal palustrine area; specifically, in the marine-terrestrial ecotone of Campeche, Mexico. Geoindicator values during the 1974-1991 and 1991-2001 periods were low, 46.5% and 40.9%, respectively, due to the intrinsic limitations of coastal wetlands for productive activities. Urban and suburban transition areas showed high degrees of modification of about 39.5% and 32.1% for the first and the second period, respectively. Moderate modification, 4.9% in the first period and 5.7% in the second, was observed in isolated landscape units with recovering vegetation. The proposed geoindicator showed physiognomic and functional evidence of affectation levels from human activities, regeneration patterns and alteration of the landscape structure, modulated by the historical-economic process in the studied area.																	0034-7744	2215-2075				SEP	2014	62	3					1111	1128		10.15517/rbt.v62i3.12215								WOS:000343187200023	25412539

Land cover and land use change related to shrimp farming in coastal areas of Quang Ninh, Vietnam using remotely sensed data	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Rapid development of shrimp farming may lead to unrecognized and undesirable changes of land cover/land use patterns in coastal areas. Of special concern is the loss of mangrove forest in coastal areas such as Quang Ninh, Vietnam, which is adjacent to the World Heritage-listed Ha Long Bay. Understanding the status and changes of land cover/land use for coastal shrimp farms and mangrove forests can support environmental protection and decision-making for sustainable development in coastal areas. Within this context, this paper uses the 1999/2001 Landsat ETM+ and the 2008 ALOS AVNIR-2 imagery to investigate the contraction and expansion of shrimp farms and mangrove forests in coastal areas of Ha Long and Mong Cai, which now have a high concentration of intensive and semi-intensive shrimp farms. Images were separately analyzed and classified before using post-classification comparisons to detect land cover/land use changes in the study area. The results of this study found that the area of mangrove forest has been reduced by an estimated 927.5 ha in Ha Long and 1,144.4 ha in Mong Cai, while shrimp farming areas increased by an estimated 1,195.9 and 1,702.5 ha, respectively, over the same period. The majority of shrimp farms in Mong Cai were established at the expense of mangrove forest (49.4 %) while shrimp farms in Ha Long were mainly constructed on areas previously occupied by bare ground (46.5 %) and a significant proportion also replaced mangroves (23.9 %). The remarkable rate of mangrove loss and shrimp farming expansion detected in this study, over a relatively short time scale indicate that greater awareness of environmental impacts of shrimp farm expansion is required if this industry is to be sustainable, the important estuarine and coastal marine ecosystems are to be protected over the long term, and the capturing and storing of carbon in mangrove systems are to be enhanced for global climate change mitigation and for use as carbon offsets.

J	Vanhellemont, Q; Ruddick, K				Vanhellemont, Quinten; Ruddick, Kevin			Turbid wakes associated with offshore wind turbines observed with Landsat 8	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												In the last decade, the number of offshore wind farms has increased rapidly. Offshore wind farms are typically constructed in near-shore, shallow waters. These waters can be highly productive or provide nursery grounds for fish. EU legislation requires assessment of the environmental impact of the wind farms. The effects on hard and soft substrate fauna, seabirds and marine mammals are most frequently considered. Here we present Landsat-8 imagery that reveals the impact of offshore wind farms on suspended sediments. Turbid wakes of individual turbines are observed that are aligned with tidal currents. They are 30-150 m wide, and several km in length. The environmental impact of these wakes and the source of the suspended material are still unclear, but the wake size warrants further study. The underwater light field will be affected by increased suspended sediments and the turbid wakes could significantly impact sediment transport and downstream sedimentation. The question of whether such features can be detected by other remote sensors is addressed by a theoretical analysis of the signal:noise specification for the Operational Land Imager (OLI), the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM +), the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR/3), the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI), the Flexible Combined Imager (FCI) and the Multispectral Instrument (MSI) and by a demonstration of the impact of processing OLI data for different spatial resolutions.

Srinivas			Evaluation of various image classification techniques on Landsat to identify coral reefs	GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK												Coral reefs are one of the prominent marine ecosystems in the world. Coral reefs are facing threats from both natural and anthropogenic factors. Monitoring, protecting and studying these ecosystems are considered as a complex process because they are underwater features. Remote sensing can be quite useful in this by providing huge amount of database of satellite images. Landsat series have been providing satellite data for last 50years and now it is one of the large databases providing satellite imageries. Accurate processing of these images can increase the accuracy of coral reef information extraction from these images. Classification is one of the important processes that can give adequate and precise information about coral reefs. This study is intended to compare various supervised classification techniques available for extraction of information from the image and to suggest best of them. Maximum Likelihood and Support Vector Machine have proven to be good classification module that can be used to classify Landsat Images to coral reef detection and monitoring.																	1947-5705	1947-5713				APR 3	2014	5	2					173	184		10.1080/19475705.2013.802748								WOS:000335002900006

Change detection of coral reef habitat using Landsat-5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 OLI data in the Red Sea (Hurghada, Egypt)	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Owing to continuing touristic developments in Hurghada, Egypt, several coral reef habitats have suffered major deterioration between 1987 and 2013, either by being bleached or totally lost. Such alterations in coral reef habitats have been well observed in their varying distributions using change detection analysis applied to a Landsat 5 image representing 1987, a Landsat 7 image representing 2000, and a Landsat 8 image representing 2013. Different processing techniques were carried out over the three images, including but not limited to rectification, masking, water column correction, classification, and change detection statistics. The supervised classifications performed over the three scenes show five significant marine-related classes, namely coral, sand subtidal, sand intertidal, macro-algae, and seagrass, in different degrees of abundance. The change detection statistics obtained from the classified scenes of 1987 and 2000 reveal a significant increase in the macro-algae and seagrass classes (93 and 47%, respectively). However, major decreases of 41, 40, and 37% are observed in the sand intertidal, coral, and sand subtidal classes, respectively. On the other hand, the change detection statistics obtained from the classified scenes of 2000 and 2013 revealed increases in sand subtidal and macro-algae classes by 14 and 19%, respectively, while major decreases of 49%, 46% and 74% are observed in the sand intertidal, coral, and seagrass classes, respectively.

Sustained increase in ice discharge fromthe Amundsen Sea Embayment, West Antarctica, from1973 to 2013	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												We combine measurements of ice velocity from Landsat feature tracking and satellite radar interferometry, and ice thickness from existing compilations to document 41 years of mass flux from the Amundsen Sea Embayment (ASE) of West Antarctica. The total ice discharge has increased by 77% since 1973. Half of the increase occurred between 2003 and 2009. Grounding-line ice speeds of Pine Island Glacier stabilized between 2009 and 2013, following a decade of rapid acceleration, but that acceleration reached far inland and occurred at a rate faster than predicted by advective processes. Flow speeds across Thwaites Glacier increased rapidly after 2006, following a decade of near-stability, leading to a 33% increase in flux between 2006 and 2013. Haynes, Smith, Pope, and Kohler Glaciers all accelerated during the entire study period. The sustained increase in ice discharge is a possible indicator of the development of a marine ice sheet instability in this part of Antarctica.

Poleward expansion of mangroves is a threshold response to decreased frequency of extreme cold events	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Regional warming associated with climate change is linked with altered range and abundance of species and ecosystems worldwide. However, the ecological impacts of changes in the frequency of extreme events have not been as well documented, especially for coastal and marine environments. We used 28 y of satellite imagery to demonstrate that the area of mangrove forests has doubled at the northern end of their historic range on the east coast of Florida. This expansion is associated with a reduction in the frequency of "extreme" cold events (days colder than -4 degrees C), but uncorrelated with changes in mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation, and land use. Our analyses provide evidence for a threshold response, with declining frequency of severe cold winter events allowing for poleward expansion of mangroves. Future warming may result in increases in mangrove cover beyond current latitudinal limits of mangrove forests, thereby altering the structure and function of these important coastal ecosystems.

Since the 1960s, remote sensing has played an important role in characterizing the marine environment, with particular emphasis on sea surface features, temperature, and salinity; mapping of shorelines, wetlands, and coral reefs; local fisheries and species movements; tracking hurricanes, earthquakes, and coastal flooding; and changes in coastal upwelling and marine productivity. This chapter reviews marine applications of remote sensing worldwide, exploring contemporary satellite systems, research themes, and analytical methods. In the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador, marine remote sensing has been limited to the use of large-scale daily image-gathering systems, such as CZCS, MODIS, SeaWiFS, and AVHRR, due to persistent cloud cover and constrained research budgets. Recent advances in satellite technology and availability, however, offer new opportunities for remote sensing in the Galapagos archipelago and beyond. Moderate-resolution sensors like SPOT and Landsat continue to be relevant for regional-scale evaluations of marine and coastal environments, identifying hotspots or focal areas for the use of more fine-grained imagery like QuickBird, WorldView-2, and aerial photographs. Radar systems like Aquarius and SAR show promise in new lines of oceanographic research, including sea surface salinity and the differentiation of mangrove subspecies. The use of ancillary or in situ data for calibration and validation of remotely-sensed image analysis can overcome the limitations of sensors used in bathymetric applications, while advances in cellular and GPS technology facilitate real-time reporting from citizen scientists for integrated monitoring of environmental and social change.																	2195-1055		978-3-319-02769-2; 978-3-319-02768-5				2014							109	136		10.1007/978-3-319-02769-2_6	10.1007/978-3-319-02769-2							WOS:000364124700008						
B	Andrefouet, S		Barale, V; Gade, M		Andrefouet, Serge			Remote Sensing of Coral Reefs and Their Environments in the Red Sea and Western Indian Ocean: Research and Management	REMOTE SENSING OF THE AFRICAN SEAS												The Red Sea and the Western Indian Ocean regions offer a wide variety of coastal configurations, including large areas of coral reefs. In regions that include both developed and developing countries, coral reefs and the services they provide are critical for the livelihoods, economies and well being of local communities, while they are at risk due to both anthropogenic and natural threats. Coral reefs also offer to scientific research a unique array of ecological and geological processes specific to these regions. Both applied and fundamental aspects motivate conservation and management projects. Satellite and airborne remote sensing has contributed to scientific and management projects with a variety of sensors and products, including some of the earliest coral reef applications worldwide 30 years ago. High spatial resolution geomorphology, bathymetry and habitat maps provide a biophysical description of the reefs themselves. Oceanic fields, such as sea surface temperature regime and their anomalies, quantify how coral reefs are exposed to weather and climate forcing. The combined local and large scale spatial information help understand how coral reefs status and processes vary across space and time. In particular, data products are increasingly combined to map the resilience of coral reef and associated habitats, and to design conservation plans at different spatial scales. However, both high-tech state-of-the-art and user-friendly remote sensing are still not used as systematically as it could be, while most countries still need basic spatial information consistent at national and international scales, such as habitat maps. Future applied developments will need to address these gaps in priority products. At the same time, on-going research will continue to refine local and regional products relevant for the science and the management of the Red Sea and the Western Indian Ocean coral reefs and their environments.																			978-94-017-8008-7; 978-94-017-8007-0				2014							317	335		10.1007/978-94-017-8008-7_16	10.1007/978-94-017-8008-7							WOS:000362071100017

Examples are shown of data collected by various sensors onboard the Landsat, Systeme Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) and EgyptSat-1 satellite series, and by the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS). The remote sensing-derived parameters (e.g. lagoon size, aquatic vegetation patterns and other water quality parameters) allow to evaluate evolution and degradation of the near-coastal water bodies in the last four decades. The basic ecosystem indicators delivered by the satellite surveys are considered important contributions for the establishment of a sound decision-making process for environmental management purposes, aiming to ensure protection of natural systems and sustainability of human activities.

In this paper, the information of the two major oil spill accidents, which occurred near Wusong and Jiuduansha of Shanghai waters in 2012, were analyzed by using the HJ-1 domestic environment satellite, at the same time, validated by the multi-satellite data, such as medium resolution MODIS of ESA and Landsat-5 date, as well as the investigation of our project group at the scene of accident. At first, by applying ratio operation between oil-water sensitive channel bands, the difference between film and background water's spectral reflectance was emphasized. After that, threshold determination method based on image segmentation was used, combined with the spectrum characteristic of heavy diesel oil, the oil spills information was effectively extracted from the suspected oil films area. Putting together, the oil spills location, area and quantity were diagnosed to provide the fundamental analysis data for emergency response work.																	2153-6996		978-1-4799-5775-0				2014										10.1109/IGARSS.2014.6947109								WOS:000349688104073

The concentration of chlorophyll-a is a widely used indicator of phytoplankton abundance and eutrophication in marine aquatic systems. It is important to monitor the dynamic variation in the chlorophyll-a concentration of large areas and take effective measurements in a timely manner. The impact of the construction of the Dalian offshore airport artificial island on water quality was investigated by using HJ-1A/B-CCD satellite data regarding chlorophyll-a concentration at different time intervals. This study developed a satisfying regression model between the spectral reflection ratio and chlorophyll-a concentration based on HJ-1A/B-CCD satellite data and field data gathered from the Dalian offshore artificial island in China. The retrieval precision of the linear retrieval model for the third and fourth bands of the HJ-1A/B-CCD sensor was enough to objectively reveal the marine chlorophyll-a concentration distribution and its variation characteristics during the construction. The feasibility and effectiveness of using remote sensing to track and monitor marine environments affected by large-scale offshore artificial island construction were proved.																	2352-5401		978-94-62520-42-4				2014	5						1473	1476										WOS:000349473500332

This system is designed for investigating various processes and phenomena in the ocean and marine atmosphere using different types of satellite remotely sensed data. The STS system provides researchers with the possibilities to deal with the satellite remote sensing data as well as with the result of its analysis. The key feature of STS is the ability to work simultaneously with satellite information of different types. STS provides tools for joint analysis of different types of satellite data, as well as data of ground meteorological stations, cartographic data etc. This paper gives an overview of the system and data processing use cases. Some example cases are described including processing and joint analysis of various satellite data. The data from different sensors (obtained by Envisat ASAR, Landsat-8 OLI, Landsat-7 ETM+, Landsat-5 TM, Terra/Aqua MODIS as well as Hyperion and HICO hyperspectral data) was analyzed jointly for differentiation between different types of coastal waters, and for reconstruction of suspended matter distribution in the test areas of the Azov and Black Seas.																	0277-786X		978-1-62841-303-8				2014	9240								92401C	10.1117/12.2067300								WOS:000348196100033

There were five classes in the study site: natural forest, Melaleuca forest, agriculture, peat and built-up areas. Agricultural land and Melaleuca forest changing into built-up areas constituted approximately 51.13% of the total area changing. The benthic seagrass habitat increased dramatically from 2001 to the end of 2010. Besides, marine culture has been concerned to cage culture which is one of the sources directly affecting aquatic life and water quality in coastal environment. Cage culture locations were detected using high-resolution imagery as THEOS data for image fusion and Object-based Image Analysis methods. Water quality criteria including nitrogen, phosphorus and chlorophyll-a concentrations were determined by interpolation method, and the spatial distribution of these parameters showed a concentration in the study area in the range from 0.17 to 0.49 mg/L, 0.012 to 0.073 mg/L and 0.26 to 1.046 g/L, respectively.																	1010-6049	1752-0762					2014	29	5					486	506		10.1080/10106049.2013.798358								WOS:000340104200003						
J	He, MX; Hu, LB; Hu, CM				He, Ming-Xia; Hu, Lianbo; Hu, Chuanmin			Harbour dredging and fish mortality in an aquaculture zone: assessment of changes in suspended particulate matter using multi-sensor remote-sensing data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The semi-closed Rushan Bay is one of the largest aquaculture bases in North China, with its only navigation channel connecting the Rushan harbour and the Yellow Sea. Recent economic growth with increased import and export demands have stimulated a dredging operation, starting on 26 March 2010, which was paused on 17 June 2010 after numerous reports of mortality of cultured shellfish, such as clam (Ruditapes philippinarum), among other precious marine animals. A lawsuit was filed to settle the dispute between the dredging company and an aquaculture company, yet there was endless debate on whether the mortality was caused by the dredging operations. Here, using multi-sensor remote-sensing data collected by Landsat/ETM+, HJ-1A&1 B/CCD, and Aqua & Terra/MODIS, we addressed the two critical questions of (1) whether there was a significant increase in the suspended particulate matter (SPM) in the aquaculture area during and after the dredging operations; and (2) if the answer is yes, whether such an increase was a direct result of the dredging. After careful selection of the satellite data and algorithms, the results from all three sensors suggested positive answers to both questions. In the 2 km(2) aquaculture zone where significant mortality of cultured clam was reported, SPM derived from all three sensors during the dredging period was found to be at least 20 mg l (1) higher than that during the same period in previous years, far exceeding the 10 mg l (1) threshold value that has been used to gauge water quality degradation.																	0143-1161	1366-5901					2014	35	11-12			SI		4383	4398		10.1080/01431161.2014.916446								WOS:000337623200028

For non-interrupted observations, only the Landsat series have the potential to detect major water quality events since the 1980s. However, such ability is hindered by the unknown data quality or consistency through time. Here, using the Florida Keys as a case study, we demonstrate an approach to identify historical water quality events through improved atmospheric correction of Landsat data and cross-validation with concurrent MODIS data. After aggregation of the Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) 30-m pixels to 240-m pixels (to increase the signal-to-noise ratio), a MODIS-like atmospheric correction approach using the Landsat shortwave-infrared (SWIR) bands was developed and applied to the entire Landsat-5 TM data series between 1985 and 2010. Remote sensing reflectance (Res) anomalies from Landsat (2 standard deviations from a pixel-specific monthly climatology) were found to detect MODIS Res anomalies with over 90% accuracy for all three bands for the same period of 2002-2010. Extending this analysis for the entire Landsat-5 time-series revealed Res anomaly events in the 1980s and 1990s, some of which are corroborated by known ecosystem changes due in part to changes in local freshwater flow. Indeed, TM Res anomalies were shown to be useful in detecting shifts in seagrass density, turbidity increases, black water events, and phytoplankton blooms. These findings have large implications for ongoing and future water quality assessment in the Florida Keys as well as in many other coastal regions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

An attempt has been made to study the length of shoreline changes along three provinces in the upper gulf of Thailand. The significant purpose is to investigate coastline length changes and to evaluate those different coastal changes at different times. Two specialties of chosen areas are the outstanding location at mouth of river in curve pattern and ecological important mangrove forest, as nominated and designated area listed in Ramsar convention, international wetlands treaty. In employing the remote sensing will help to investigate the shoreline erosion, stable or construction shoreline. Rapid and drastic shoreline changes have been compared and measured base on satellite image Landsat 5 TM on 1994, 2002 and 2007 at path129 row 051. There were geometrically co-registered and, in the process were resampled to 25m. By composing RGB band, fusion, supervised classification. By apply different theories will give different results but the similarly pattern. Training sites were selected by signature editor, area of interest, evaluate by seperabilitly and contingency. Principle component analysis (PCA) was employed as a method of change detection. This is to conclude that these shoreline areas were in erosion from natural processes and manmade activities, for example, aquaculture and agriculture expansion, such as shrimp farm. These coastal line lost were not just losing the land; it's losing the soul of the cycle of marine life, economically, and environmentally. Moreover, this project, in the future, could benefit to set the recovery buffer zone for mangrove restoration also.																	2194-9034						2014	40-8						1079	1083		10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-8-1079-2014								WOS:000368425300170

DELINEATION OF SUB-PIXEL LEVEL SEDIMENTARY LITHO-CONTACTS BY SUPER RESOLUTION MAPPING OF LANDSAT TM IMAGE	ISPRS TECHNICAL COMMISSION VIII SYMPOSIUM	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				ISPRS Technical Commission VIII Symposium	DEC 09-12, 2014	Hyderabad, INDIA	ISPRS Tech Commiss, Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing, Indian Soc Remote Sensing, Indian Soc Geomat				To delineate the geological formation at the surface, satellite image classification approaches are often preferred. This study aims to produce a super resolved map with better delineation of the litho-contacts from the medium resolution Landsat image. Conventionally used per-pixel classification provides an output map at the same resolution of the satellite image, while the super resolved map provides the high resolution output map using the medium resolution image. In this study, four test sites are considered for delineating different litho-contacts using super resolution mapping approach in Cuddalore district, southern India. The test sites consists of charnockite, fissile hornblende-biotite gneiss, marine sandstone and sandstone with clay, limestone with calcareous shale and clay, clay with limestone bands/lenses, mio-pliocene and quaternary argillaceous and calcareous sandstone, fluvial and fluviomarine formations. This work compares the per-pixel, super resolved output derived from linear spectral unmixing (LSU) based HNN and spectral angle mapper (SAM) based HNN approaches. The super resolution mapping approach was performed on the medium resolution (30m) Landsat image to obtain the litho-contact maps and the results are compared with the existing maps and observations from field visits. The results showed improved accuracy (90.92%) of the map prepared by the SAM based super resolution approach compared to the LSU based super resolution approach (90.14%) and the maximum likelihood classification approach (83.74%). Such an improved accuracy of the super resolved map (6m resolution) is due to the fact that the lithological mapping is done not merely at the resolution of the image, but at the sub-pixel level. Hence, it is inferred that super resolution mapping applied to multispectral images may be preferred for mapping lithounits and litho-contacts than the conventional per-pixel and sub-pixel image classification methods.																	2194-9034						2014	40-8						1389	1396		10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-8-1389-2014								WOS:000368425300218

In this study, we evaluated the applicability of hyperspectral imagery collected from Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) for benthic habitat mapping in the Florida Keys. An overall accuracy of 84.3% and 86.7% was achieved respectively for a group-level (3-class) and code-level (12-class) classification by integrating object-based image analysis (OBIA), hyperspectral image processing methods, and machine learning algorithms. Accurate and informative object-based benthic habitat maps were produced. Three commonly used image correction procedures (atmospheric, sun-glint, and water-column corrections) were proved unnecessary for small area mapping in the Florida Keys. Inclusion of bathymetry data in the mapping procedure did not increase the classification accuracy. This study indicates that hyperspectral systems are promising in accurate benthic habitat mapping at a fine detail level. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The mixing of river water and seawater sustains biodiversity and provides brackish-water nursery grounds for both commercially important and endangered marine species. The Colorado River no longer reaches the sea except during particularly high tides and anomalously wet years. The river's relict channel is now obstructed by an accumulation of sediments deposited during flood tides; ebb flows are not strong enough to keep the channel open. Landsat 5-TM and Landsat-7 scenes from the Colorado River delta and tide prediction tables were used to reconstruct river-sea connectivity and geomorphic processes after 50 years of extensive human manipulation of the Colorado River. Historical documentation, previous topographic surveys and sediment cores were used to estimate sedimentation rates in the lower river channel. Satellite images and tide charts show that currently the river reaches the sea or the sea reaches the river about 12 days per year, unlike 10 years ago when a year-round connection existed. Reduction in connectivity results from the evolution of a tidal sandbar located within the bedload convergence zone, about 35 km upstream from the river's mouth. Historical documentation and sediment core analyses suggest sedimentation rates in the range of 10-21 cm per year. With the current conditions prevailing, active management - dredging - is required and needs to occur once every 5-10 years to reconnect the remaining riparian wetlands in the Colorado River to the Gulf of California.

They also support a high diversity of terrestrial and marine fauna. Mangroves have been heavily exploited anthropogenically and destroyed for shrimp farming. An important amount of coastal commercial fisheries depend on mangroves during at least one stage of their life history and thus loss of mangrove habitat may alter their cycle. The San Ignacio-Navachiste-Macapule Lagoon area is strongly used by local fishermen for shrimp, blue crab, stripped mullet, snapper, and cockles. Landsat 5TM satellite of 1990, 1994, 1999, 2004, and 2009 images were used to process mangrove coverage with supervised classification. Fish landings were obtained from the regional and local fishery offices. We observed that the five fisheries together were strongly related to mangrove cover. A simple correlation between mangrove coverage and landings was carried out. Also, 119 fishermen were spatially referenced within the lagoon system and fishing gears were documented. A 90.67% precision and 0.86 kappa index was obtained, where errors were most frequent when classifying other vegetation as mangroves. Mangrove coverage did not change significantly between 1994 and 2009, ranging from11,886 to 11,929 ha. The five fisheries landings were 86,023 tons. Shrimp and blue crab catches were the most important species with similar to 90% of the total catches. A positive and significant (p < 0.05) correlation was observed for all fisheries together and shrimp. Gillnet and cast net are the most important fishing gears used inside the lagoon, 31.09% and 24.37%, respectively. Strong correlations suggest the importance of mangroves to support coastal fisheries; however other anthropogenic pressures within the system such as fishing effort and eutrophication may play an important role in the resource availability.

Trends in Deltaic Change over Three Decades in the Asia-Pacific Region	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Over the past decades, studies have shown considerable change in mangrove and deltaic systems around the world. Arguments for the controlling processes encompass natural and anthropogenic phenomena, including sea level rise, storms, sediment supply changes and enhanced subsidence. To evaluate whether similar gross trends are apparent across several larger systems, this research employed a consistent methodology to conduct region-wide change analyses of five major mangrove deltaic systems in the Asia-Pacific region that are reported to be under varying degrees of risk ("no risk," Fly and Kikori-Purari; "in peril," Ganges-Brahmaputra, Irrawaddy, Mekong). With the use of a full-scale semiautomated classification, the extent of mangroves was mapped and compared for two Landsat satellite image series at least 20 years apart. Overall, we found a net contraction in mangrove area of 76 km(2), or 0.28%, but trends in mangrove change varied across the five systems. We document net contractions in the Ganges-Brahmaputra, Fly, and Kikori-Purari and a net expansion in the Irrawaddy and Mekong. The biggest relative decline in mangrove area occurred in the Fly delta, which experienced a decline of 3.9% over 36 years. The largest relative increase of 2.7% over 20 years occurred in the Irrawaddy, whereas the Mekong was relatively stable with only a modest 0.14% decline over 20 years. System-wide patterns and rates of change were variable and complex. Generally, erosion is occurring at the mouths of rivers, where exposure to ocean processes (e.g. waves) is greatest, despite the large sediment supply by these great rivers (albeit reduced in some cases). The observed losses in the Ganges-Brahmaputra are not surprising considering the known anthropogenic effects, but given that similar change trends are occurring in the Fly and Kikori-Purari delta systems despite potentially increased sediment loading (e.g. from deforestation and mining) and without other anthropogenic effects (subsurface withdrawals or river rerouting), some of this morphological change might be attributed to an enhanced eustatic sea level rise. However, change in climate, marine processes (e.g. wave conditions), effective sea level rise (e.g. a local oceanographic or tectonically controlled response), or autogenic geomorphodynamics cannot be ruled out. Alarmingly, deltas that have the greatest and most intact mangrove systems (the Fly and Kikori-Purari systems) or those parts of deltas that are still forested, such as in the western Sundarbans, are being eroded the fastest of the studied systems. A more concerted effort to monitor large-scale delta changes is recommended.					Walsh, J.

Until now, reports on damages caused by storms and hurricanes on seagrass beds are uncommon and highly variable. The seagrass meadows of the East end of Jardines de la Reina archipelago were surveyed from Nov. 29th to Dec. 5th of 2008, in order to determinate the effects from the passing of Hurricane Paloma: a category three storm on the Saffir-Simpsom scale. A rapid field assessment of the affected areas was carried out using the manta tow technique. In six sites, seagrass was quantitatively evaluated using a 15cm diameter core (four sampling units per site) and shoot density was calculated. Remote sensing techniques were used to estimate seagrass cover. To estimate the percentage of affected areas, a Region of Interest (ROI) was first created over a Landsat image. The percentage of seagrass affected within the ROI was estimated through direct georeferentiation of the contours of the damaged area and with a comparison to the total seagrass extension. To find possible explanations for damages, a false colour image was created using the near infrared band, to highlight the differences between emerged and submerged zones. The direction of winds was estimated using ArcGis 9.2 creating circular buffers, from the centre of the hurricane and generating lines tangent to the buffers. Seagrass in the region was dominated by the angiosperm Thalassia testudinum. Regional mean density was 1 321 +/- 721 shoots/m(2), a value regarded as high for the Caribbean area. Seagrass meadows were partly affected by sediment accumulation on the shoots of T testudinum and uprooting rhizomes. The 7.6km(2) disturbed area represented 1% of the total seagrass area. Other sites, closer to the centre of the hurricane, did not show any damages on the marine vegetation. The keys location with respect to the hurricane track was the most likely cause of the effects. To the North of the affected area there is an opening among the keys where the generation of waves, currents and turbulence could have occurred. Three years after the hurricane event, both vegetation cover loss and silt re-colonization by macroalgae species were observed within the affected area, by showing a patchily-vegetated landscape. This site is currently undergoing a temporal succession whose assessment demands a monitoring scheme, that will provide interesting information to document its future evolution and responsiveness against upcoming natural or anthropogenic events.																	0034-7744					SEP	2013	61	3					1425	1432										WOS:000324509200033	24027933

Fifty years of changes in reef flat habitats of the Grand R,cif of Toliara (SW Madagascar) and the impact of gleaning	CORAL REEFS												The Grand R,cif of Toliara (GRT) in Madagascar is a large (33 km(2)) barrier reef system of the SW Indian Ocean that had been well investigated in the 1960s and early 1970s. A massive degradation of the reef has been reported since at least the early 1980s, just a few years after research activities ceased in the area. Examination of historical aerial photographs and modern high-resolution remote sensing images confirms a continuous loss of coral habitat on GRT outer reef flats between 1962 and 2011, with an average loss of 65 % and a range of 37-79 % loss during this 50-year period. The usual suspects of coral community declines (cyclones, bleaching and sedimentation) may have contributed to the demise of the GRT. However, an independent study (Salimo 1997) suggests that the chronic pressure of fisherman gleaning on reef flats with destructive tools is the main driver of the observed changes. Salimo's reported level of frequentation (6.8 fishermen per day and per km(-2)) and rates of destruction per fisherman (7.7 m(2) of coral habitat h(-1)) yield a cumulated overall loss in agreement with the image-based rates of habitat loss. The GRT is unlikely to recover because this chronic stress is unlikely to decrease in the near future. Indeed, the GRT daily provides subsistence fishery resources for local Vezo people and to agriculturalist or pastoralist ethnic groups who have turned to exploiting coastal resources due to increasing aridity and dwindling agricultural and livestock production.

Increasing impervious surfaces in the Zhoushan Islands due to new development and increased population have an ecological impact on the runoff and water quality. Based on time-series classification and the complement of vegetation fraction in urban regions, Landsat thematic mapper and other high-resolution satellite images were applied to monitor the dynamics of impervious surface area (ISA) in the Zhoushan Islands from 1986 to 2011. Landsat-derived ISA results were validated by the high-resolution Worldview-2 and aerial photographs. The validation shows that mean relative errors of these ISA maps are < 15%. The results reveal that the ISA in the Zhoushan Islands increased from 19.2 km(2) in 1986 to 86.5 km(2) in 2011, and the period from 2006 to 2011 had the fastest expansion rate of 5.59 km(2) per year. The major land conversions to high densities of ISA were from the tidal zone and arable lands. The expansions of ISA were unevenly distributed and most of them were located along the periphery of these islands. Time-series maps revealed that ISA expansions happened continuously over the last 25 years. Our analysis indicated that the policy and the topography were the dominant factors controlling the spatial patterns of ISA and its expansions in the Zhoushan Islands. With continuous urbanization processes, the rapid ISA expansions may not be stopped in the near feature. (C) The Authors. Published by SPIE under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License.

Seasonal spectral variation of Zostera noltii and its influence on pigment-based Vegetation Indices	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												The influence of phenological variations on the reflectance of the intertidal marine angiosperm Zostera noltii was studied using spectroradiometry and pigment analysis. Leaves were sampled each month from March to November and spectral reflectance was measured in the 400-900 nm wavelength range in the laboratory for increasing biomass. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) was used to assess the pigment composition and concentration of the leaves and their epiphytes. Several vegetation indices (VIs) were tested for their sensitivity to seasonal variations, from NDVI-like ratios to indices based on derivative analysis. Pigment concentration showed a seasonal effect, with the highest concentrations observed in summer, synchronous with the above-ground biomass peak. The seasonal variations were clearly visible in the leaf reflectance spectrum, showing for the same amount of vegetation, lower reflectance in summer for the visible wavelengths and a higher near-infrared (NIR) plateau compared to the other months. Indices based on the difference between the red and NIR reflectance values, typically all the NDVI-like ratios, were the most sensitive to seasonal variations in pigment concentration. In fact, seasonal effects were systematically reduced for VIs including a blue band correction, namely the modified Specific Ratio (mSR((705))), the modified Normalized Difference (mND((705))), the modified NDVIs for Landsat FORMOSAT and narrow band NDVI (mNDVI((673))) as well as the Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index (ARVI). However, these indices showed a faster saturation for increasing seagrass biomass, except for the mSR((705)), which was the least sensitive to biomass saturation. The interesting properties of this index suggest that it should now be tested for airborne or satellite remote sensing mapping of Z. noltii beds but it requires a high spectral resolution and cannot be applied to multispectral satellite images.

Tectonically, Ras Banas peninsula is considered as a part of Pre-Miocene continental slope. Their sedimentary successions account the sedimentation history from Middle Miocene up to Holocene which in part documents the deformational impacts that accompanied the Red Sea rifling. The Ras Banas sedimentary succession exhibits frequent unconformities and conspicuous lithologic variations comprising mixed siliciclastics/carbonate facies, evaporites, open marine and organic build up limestone as well as coral reefs, continental sandy gravels and beach sands. The carbonate succession at the area documents the highstand status of the Red Sea water from Middle Miocene to Pleistocene in accord to the global sea-level fluctuations. The chemical data of the studied rock units substantiates the field and petrographical results. On silica- lime- magnesia diagram, the syn-rifting mixed siliciclastics/carbonates are scattered between the quartz and dolomite reference points. The post-rifting carbonates are mainly pure dolostone, limestone and sandy limestone. Norm calculations indicate that the evaporites are mainly gypsum and anhydrite with substantial normative dolomite. The tectono-sedimentary evolution of Ras Banas sedimentary sequence in relation to Red Sea rifling phases and sea level fluctuations is discussed. New mapping was undertaken for the Ras Banas Peninsula using remote sensing and GIS techniques including band ratioing, principle component analysis and false color composition. Based on mineralogical data, special interest has been paid to the diagnostic spectral features that discriminate between evaporites and carbonates on one hand and between dolomite and calcite on the other.

Land-cover change in the conterminous United States from 1973 to 2000	GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS												Land-cover change in the conterminous United States was quantified by interpreting change from satellite imagery for a sample stratified by 84 ecoregions. Gross and net changes between 11 land-cover classes were estimated for 5 dates of Landsat imagery (1973, 1980, 1986, 1992, and 2000). An estimated 673,000 km(2)(8.6%) of the United States' land area experienced a change in land cover at least one time during the study period. Forest cover experienced the largest net decline of any class with 97,000 km(2) lost between 1973 and 2000. The large decline in forest cover was prominent in the two regions with the highest percent of overall change, the Marine West Coast Forests (24.5% of the region experienced a change in at least one time period) and the Eastern Temperate Forests (11.4% of the region with at least one change). Agriculture declined by approximately 90,000 km(2) with the largest annual net loss of 12,000 km(2) yr(-1) occurring between 1986 and 1992. Developed area increased by 33% and with the rate of conversion to developed accelerating rate over time. The time interval with the highest annual rate of change of 47,000 km(2) yr(-1) (0.6% per year) was 1986-1992. This national synthesis documents a spatially and temporally dynamic era of land change between 1973 and 2000. These results quantify land change based on a nationally consistent monitoring protocol and contribute fundamental estimates critical to developing understanding of the causes and consequences of land change in the conterminous United States.

The large number of people who live close to the coast and rely directly on marine resources for food and income paradoxically increases the value of, but also the threats to, these ecosystems. A key strategy of the Coral Triangle Initiative is to protect shallow coastal ecosystems through the design and implementation of resilient networks of marine protected areas (MPAs). This strategy requires accurate spatial data on the distribution and extent of coastal habitats (coral reef, seagrass and mangrove) at scales which match conservation planning decisions. In the Coral Triangle, seagrass distribution maps are not readily available at ecoregional scales. The Lesser Sunda ecoregion, extending from Bali, Indonesia to Timor-Leste, is one of 11 ecoregions of the Coral Triangle and a high priority for conservation and sustainable management of marine resources. To support the design of a resilient MPA network for the Lesser Sunda ecoregion, a seagrass distribution map was generated based on Landsat imagery, literature review and groundtruth data. Seagrass beds were estimated to cover an area of 273 km(2) at an overall accuracy of 78%. Use of the seagrass distribution map in the MPA design improved the habitat representation and connectivity - key criteria for resilient MPA design. The final MPA design included 80 km(2) of seagrass beds, with more than half the beds adjacent to coral reefs and mangroves. This study demonstrates the effective use of Landsat imagery and remote sensing techniques to derive ecoregional scale seagrass maps supporting MPA network design. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Ningaloo Marine Park (including the Muiron Islands) in north-western Australia (stretching across three degrees of latitude) was mapped to 20 m depth using HyMap airborne hyperspectral imagery (125 bands) at 3.5 m resolution across the 762 km(2) of reef environment between the shoreline and reef slope. The imagery was corrected for atmospheric, air-water interface and water column influences to retrieve bottom reflectance and bathymetry using the physics-based Modular Inversion and Processing System. Using field-validated, image-derived spectra from a representative range of cover types, the classification combined a semi-automated, pixel-based approach with fuzzy logic and derivative techniques. Five thematic classification levels for benthic cover (with probability maps) were generated with varying degrees of detail, ranging from a basic one with three classes (biotic, abiotic and mixed) to the most detailed with 46 classes. The latter consisted of all abiotic and biotic seabed components and hard coral growth forms in dominant or mixed states. The overall accuracy of mapping for the most detailed maps was 70% for the highest classification level. Macro-algal communities formed most of the benthic cover, while hard and soft corals represented only about 7% of the mapped area (58.6 km(2)). Dense tabulate coral was the largest coral mosaic type (37% of all corals) and the rest of the corals were a mix of tabulate, digitate, massive and soft corals. Our results show that for this shallow, fringing reef environment situated in the arid tropics, hyperspectral remote sensing techniques can offer an efficient and cost-effective approach to mapping and monitoring reef habitats over large, remote and inaccessible areas.

J	Guneroglu, A; Karsli, F; Dihkan, M				Guneroglu, Abdulaziz; Karsli, Fevzi; Dihkan, Mustafa			Automatic detection of coastal plumes using Landsat TM/ETM plus images	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Riverine fresh water outflows create coastal plumes that are distinguished from surrounding sea water by their specific spectral signature. Coastal waters are unique ecosystems, and they are very important in terms of living resources and oceanographic processes. River plumes and coastal turbid waters have important effects on coastal marine ecosystems, and they also influence marine life cycles, sediment distribution, and pollution. Remote sensing and digital image-processing techniques provide an effective tool to detect and monitor these plume zones over large areas. The primary goal of this study was automatic detection and monitoring of coastal plume zones using multispectral Landsat Thematic Mapper/Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (TM/ETM+) imagery. For that purpose, the proposed algorithm exploits spectral features of the multispectral images by using feature extraction and decision-making steps. The procedure has two main stages: (1) some pre-processing operations were applied to the images in order to extract the plume core reflectance values with maximum turbidity and offshore water mass reflectance values; (2) a k-means algorithm was applied with initial seed values of reflectance computed from the pre-processing stage to classify coastal plume zones. Spatial pattern and variability of optical characteristics of coastal plume zones were then defined following the results of the classification process. The algorithm was automatically applied in three different regions with three multispectral Landsat images acquired on different dates, and yielded a very high classification accuracy in detecting coastal plume zones.																	0143-1161					JUL 10	2013	34	13					4702	4714		10.1080/01431161.2013.782116								WOS:000317840200011

These fragile ecosystems are in need for conservation. The coastal state of Bahia hosts the most extensive and richest area of coral reefs in the South Atlantic Ocean. Assessment, planning and management of coral reef ecosystems are particularly challenging tasks. This work shows how the creation of a GIS improves the process of management, monitoring and conservation of the Bahian reef environments The initial data input started by the vectorization of 1) bathymetric data from the Bureau of Hydrography and Navigation (DHN), 2) shoreline and mangrove areas from Landsat 7 ETM + images, 3) near surface reefs from Quickbird images, and 4) coastal and marine protected areas of federal, state and local administrations. Geological, physical, biological and social information was then included in order to create a suitable marine GIS for conservation aims. The data includes information on sediment granulometry and transport patterns, rocky substrate outcrops, sea surface temperature, wave direction, rain precipitation, major contributing river discharge, artisanal fishery, benthic cover and bleaching data. ReefBahia GIS has provided essential information for a better understanding of coral reefs of the state of Bahia geological and ecological characteristics such as mapping, representation, connectivity and biodiversity of coral reefs, geological facies, Quaternary sedimentation, numeric modeling of wave refraction and monitoring of bleaching events.

Golam; Banu, Mehmuna R.; Seker, Dursun Zafer			Monitoring the drastic growth of ship breaking yards in Sitakunda: a threat to the coastal environment of Bangladesh	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The vast coastal and marine resources that occur along the southern edge of Bangladesh make it one of the most productive areas of the world. However, due to growing anthropogenic impacts, this area is under considerable environmental pressure from both physical and chemical stress factors. Ship breaking, or the dismantling and demolition of out-of-service ocean-going vessels, has become increasingly common in many coastal areas. To investigate the extent of ship breaking activities in Bangladesh along the Sitakunda coast, various spatial and non-spatial data were obtained, including remote sensing imagery, statistical records and published reports. Impacts to coastal and marine life were documented. Available data show that ship breaking activities cause significant physical disturbance and release toxic materials into the environment, resulting in adverse effects to numerous marine taxonomic groups such as fish, mammals, birds, reptiles, plants, phytoplankton, zooplankton and benthic invertebrates. Landsat imagery illustrates that the negatively impacted coastal area has grown 308.7 % from 367 ha in 1989 to 1,133 ha in 2010. Physicochemical and biological properties of coastal soil and water indicate substantially elevated pollution that poses a risk of local, regional and even global contamination through sea water and atmospheric transport. While damage to the coastal environment of Bangladesh is a recognized hazard that must be addressed, the economic benefits of ship breaking through job creation and fulfilling the domestic demand for recycled steel must be considered. Rather than an outright ban on beach breaking of ships, the enterprise must be recognized as a true and influential industry that should be held responsible for developing an economically viable and environmentally proactive growth strategy. Evolution of the industry toward a sustainable system can be aided through reasonable and enforceable legislative and judicial action that takes a balanced approach, but does not diminish the value of coastal conservation.

J	Kawy, WAMA				Kawy, Wael Ahmed Mohamed Abdel			Using GIS modeling to assess the agricultural sustainability in Kafr El-Sheikh governorate, Nile Delta, Egypt	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												The evaluation of agricultural sustainability status helps in identifying specific indicators that constrain the achievement of sustainable agriculture. The agricultural sector in Egypt is facing major sustainability constraints such as scarce land and water resources, environmental degradation, and rapid population growth as well as institutional arrangement including land tenure and farm fragmentation, agricultural administration, lack of infrastructure, and credit utilization and high interest rates. This study aims to evaluate the agricultural sustainability in some areas in Kafr El-Sheikh governorate, north of the Nile Delta; the international framework for evaluating sustainable land management was used for realizing this objective. The map of the physiographic soils of the studied area was produced depending upon Landsat ETM+ images analysis; the results indicate that the area includes three main landscapes, i.e., alluvial, lacustrine, and marine plains. The characteristics of productivity, security, protection, economic viability, and social acceptability in the different mapping units were assessed. The obtained results show that the studied area includes two different class types, the first are the lands that are marginally below the requirement of sustainability and the second are those lands that do not meet sustainability requirements. The former class is represented by the physiographic units of alluvial plain, whereas the latter class is represented by the physiographic units of the lacustrine and marine plains. The sustainability constrains in the studied area are related to the soil productivity, economic viability, and social acceptability.																	1866-7511					MAR	2013	6	3					733	747		10.1007/s12517-011-0377-5								WOS:000315647700010

Monitoring estuarine water quality using satellite imagery. The Mondego river estuary (Portugal) as a case study	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												Monitoring water bodies is a task not only scientifically relevant but also legally binding in several countries (e.g. Water Framework Directive and the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive). Ecosystem health assessment projects are greatly enhanced by the use of remote sensing technologies. In the present study, a small Portuguese estuary (Mondego river estuary), was used as a case study to assess the feasibility of measuring several key indicators using satellite imagery. The feasibility of using MODIS land/cloud bands to evaluate Secchi Disk Depth (SD) was addressed. The ratio of remote sensing reflectance at 469 and 555 nm was the best predictor for this parameter (R-2 = 0.9678; p < 0.05). Landsat-7 ETM+ was, in turn, used to estimate Chlorophyll-a concentration (OC), Turbidity and Salinity. Reflectance values were compared with concurrent in situ data recorded by an automatic sampling buoy. ETM-F data was also used to develop a local water color index, which takes advantage of the relative differences in the reflectance values of the three bands in the visible range of the spectrum. Overall, remote sensing data yielded robust estimates of the selected indicators, favoring its future operational use in the study area. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Assessing the extent of carbonate deposition in early rift settings	AAPG BULLETIN												Select lacustrine and marine depositional settings show a spectrum of styles of carbonate deposition and illustrate the types of carbonates, with an emphasis on microbialites and tufa, to be expected in early rift settings. Early rift lake examples examined in this review article are all from East Africa: Lakes Turkana, Bogoria, Natron and Magadi, Manyara, and Tanganyika. Other lake examples include four from the western United States (Great Salt Lake and high lake level Lake Bonneville, Mono Lake and high lake level Russell Lake, Pyramid Lake and high lake level Lake Lahontan, and Searles Lake) and two from Australia (Lakes Clifton and Thetis). Marine basin examples are the Hamelin Pool part of Shark Bay from Australia (marginal marine) and the Red Sea (marine rift). Landsat images and digital elevation models for each example are used to delineate present and past lake-basin margins based on published lake-level elevations, and for some examples, the shorelines representing different lake levels can be compared to evaluate how changes in size, shape, and lake configuration might have impacted carbonate development. The early rift lakes show a range of characteristics to be expected in lacustrine settings during the earliest stages of continental extension and rifting, whereas the Red Sea shows well advanced rifting with marine incursion and reef skeletal sand development. Collectively, the lacustrine examples show a wide range of sizes, with several of them being large enough that they could produce carbonate deposits of potential economic interest. Three of the areas-Great Salt Lake and high lake level Lake Bonneville, Pyramid Lake and high lake level Lake Lahontan, and the Red Sea-are exceedingly complex in that they illustrate a large degree of potential depositional fades heterogeneity because of their size, irregular pattern, and connectivity of subbasins within the overall basin outline.

The objective of this study was to generate the coastal and marine habitat map for the Straits of Malacca using the SPOT and Landsat data acquired at low tide in 2010 similar to 2012. Images were first processed with atmospheric and geometric correction. The hierarchical unsupervised classification and contextual editing were then used to produce the final habitat map. The WorldView2 and GeoEye data were also used for evaluating purposes in some studied area. Our classification scheme included sandy beach, mangrove forest, mud /sand flat, seagrass /algae, coral reefs, water and others. The produced habitat map provides the most up to date habitat information in the Straits of Malacca and will aid for the regional coastal ecosystems assessment as well as for future comparative study.

(Mitch); Ellis, James			PATTERNS OF SEDIMENTATION IN THE CONTEMPORARY RED SEA AS AN ANALOG FOR ANCIENT CARBONATES IN RIFT SETTINGS	JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY RESEARCH												Patterns of sedimentation in the Red Sea offer a contemporary analog for carbonate deposition in marine rift settings. Covering 20 degrees of latitude, the sea is sufficiently long to display pronounced climate differences and the clear tropical waters support vigorous coral reef growth and associated production of carbonate sediment. Six focus areas within the Red Sea, each covering exactly 1,600 sq. km, illustrate the variability of spatial patterns in reefal and other carbonates in this rift setting. Five of the focus areas are located on a north-south transect along the western margin of the sea: (1) Gubal Straits (Egypt), (2) Shalatayn (Egypt), (3) Trinkitat (Sudan), (4) Dahlak (Eritrea), and (5) Halib (Eritrea); and one is from the eastern margin: (6) Farasan Banks (Saudi Arabia). Using Landsat imagery, water depth and two marine facies classes, "reefal frameworks" and "sediments," were mapped. Lumping these two classes define "carbonate bodies" that were analyzed for trends in orientation, relation to local fault networks, and size-frequency distribution. Fault lineaments digitized from the literature are closely related to the orientation of carbonate bodies with areas exceeding 5 sq. km. Smaller bodies do not preferentially align with fault trends. Water depth and the occurrence of reefal frameworks and sediments for the six focus areas are not systematically related. Used as an analog, these data from the contemporary Red Sea may provide insight into the orientation and scale of accumulation of carbonates in subsurface marine rift settings.																	1527-1404					NOV-DEC	2012	82	11-12					859	870		10.2110/jsr.2012.77								WOS:000314085400005

Comparing the information content of coral reef geomorphological and biological habitat maps, Amirantes Archipelago (Seychelles), Western Indian Ocean	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Increasing the use of geomorphological map products in marine spatial planning has the potential to greatly enhance return on mapping investment as they are commonly two orders of magnitude cheaper to produce than biologically-focussed maps of benthic communities and shallow substrates. The efficacy of geomorphological maps derived from remotely sensed imagery as surrogates for habitat diversity is explored by comparing two map sets of the platform reefs and atolls of the Amirantes Archipelago (Seychelles), Western Indian Ocean. One mapping campaign utilised Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imagery (19 wavebands, 1 m spatial resolution) to classify 11 islands and associated reefs into 25 biological habitat classes while the other campaign used Landsat 7 + ETM imagery (7 bands, 30 m spatial resolution) to generate maps of 14 geomorphic classes. The maps were compared across a range of characteristics, including habitat richness (number of classes mapped), diversity (Shannon-Weiner statistic) and thematic content (Cramer's V statistic). Between maps, a strong relationship was revealed for habitat richness (R-2 = 0.76), a moderate relationship for class diversity and evenness (R-2 = 0.63) and a variable relationship for thematic content, dependent on site complexity (V range 0.43 -0.93). Geomorphic maps emerged as robust predictors of the habitat richness in the Amirantes. Such maps therefore demonstrate high potential value for informing coastal management activities and conservation planning by drawing on information beyond their own thematic content and thus maximizing the return on mapping investment.

J	Huang, HJ; Liu, YX; Qiu, ZF				Huang Haijun; Liu Yanxia; Qiu Zhongfeng			Morphodynamic evolution of the Xiaoqing River mouth: a Huanghe River-derived mixed energy estuary	CHINESE JOURNAL OF OCEANOLOGY AND LIMNOLOGY												In an estuary, tidal, wave and other marine powers interact with the coast in different ways and affect estuary morphology as well as its evolution. In the Huanghe (Yellow) River estuaries and nearby delta, there are many small sediment-affected estuaries with a unique morphology, such as the Xiaoqing River estuary. In this study, we investigated the special evolution and genetic mechanism of the Xiaoqing River estuary by analyzing graphic and image data with a numerical simulation method. The results show that NE and NE-E tide waves are the main driving force for sandbar formation. Sediment shoals have originated from huge amounts of sediment from the Huanghe River, with consequent deposition at the Xiaoqing River mouth. The lateral suspended sediments beyond the river mouth move landward. Siltation takes place on the northern shoreline near the river mouth whereas erosion occurs in the south. The deposits come mainly from scouring of the shallow seabed on the northern side of the estuary. Storm surges speed up deposition in the estuary. Development of the sediment shoals has occurred in two steps involving the processes of growth and further southward extension. Although the southward shift increases the river curvature and length, the general eastward orientation of the estuary is unlikely to change. Processes on the adjacent shorelines do not affect the development of the sediment shoals. The study presents a morphodynamic evolutionary model for the Xiaoqing River estuary, with a long-term series cycle, within which a relatively short cycle occurs.

Morainal bank progradation and sediment accumulation in Disenchantment Bay, Alaska: Response to advancing Hubbard Glacier	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												Morainal banks are primary features at the margins of advancing and stable to quasi-stable temperate tidewater glaciers, yet their roles in glacier dynamics and terminus stability are poorly defined by submarine observations. Analysis of new and archival multibeam data and Landsat images of the advancing Hubbard Glacier, southeast Alaska, reveal that between 1978 and 2010 the ice face and morainal bank advanced together at an average rate of similar to 34 m/yr, varying spatially and temporally between 14 and 80 m/yr. Morphological features including gullies and a boulder lag suggest cyclical deposition and gravitational erosion on the proximal slope of the morainal bank (15-18 degrees), and possible ice pushing in an area without recent sedimentation. In contrast, the morainal bank of the nearby, quasi-stable (surging) Turner Glacier advanced steadily since 1978 by proximal sedimentation on the steep fjord wall below its hanging valley. Sedimentation in the deep (> 220 m) basin of Disenchantment Bay increased from 0.88 m/yr spanning 1978 to 1999, to 1.22 m/yr thereafter. This change appears to be a combined response to glacier advance and sediment dispersal farther down-fjord, and to an increase in sediment yield from other glacial and non-glacial sources. Analysis of Hubbard Glacier illustrates the direct correlation between movement of the terminus and morainal bank in advancing the grounding line of a marine-terminating glacier, and that morainal banks provide a fundamental stabilizing role for advance into a deep-water fjord, compensating for changes in water depth at the grounding line.

Julian			Multi-scale marine biodiversity patterns inferred efficiently from habitat image processing	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Cost-effective proxies of biodiversity and species abundance, applicable across a range of spatial scales, are needed for setting conservation priorities and planning action. We outline a rapid, efficient, and low-cost measure of spectral signal from digital habitat images that, being an effective proxy for habitat complexity, correlates with species diversity and requires little image processing or interpretation. We validated this method for coral reefs of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia, across a range of spatial scales (1 m to 10 km), using digital photographs of benthic communities at the transect scale and high-resolution Landsat satellite images at the reef scale. We calculated an index of image-derived spatial heterogeneity, the mean information gain (MIG), for each scale and related it to univariate (species richness and total abundance summed across species) and multivariate (species abundance matrix) measures of fish community structure, using two techniques that account for the hierarchical structure of the data: hierarchical (mixed-effect) linear models and distance-based partial redundancy analysis. Over the length and breadth of the GBR, MIG alone explained up to 29% of deviance in fish species richness, 33% in total fish abundance, and 25% in fish community structure at multiple scales, thus demonstrating the possibility of easily and rapidly exploiting spatial information contained in digital images to complement existing methods for inferring diversity and abundance patterns among fish communities. Thus, the spectral signal of unprocessed remotely sensed images provides an efficient and low-cost way to optimize the design of surveys used in conservation planning. In data-sparse situations, this simple approach also offers a viable method for rapid assessment of potential local biodiversity, particularly where there is little local capacity in terms of skills or resources for mounting in-depth biodiversity surveys.

A GPS and GIS method to improve management plans and rangers coverage	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION												Protected areas are the core of efforts to conserve biological diversity and zoning uses, and they are used as a tool for their management. Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) have been used to evaluate conflicts between approved uses and actual uses in La Restinga Lagoon National Park in Venezuela (LRLNP). The park (188.6 km(2)), covers various ecosystems such as coastal lagoons, marine waters and xerophytic vegetation, it is visited by up to 260,000 people visit per year. A GIS, using a base map compiled from 1:25,000 maps was developed. Natural cover was mapped from LANDSAT VII TM images, orthophotomaps and aerial photographs. Spatial use data was collected by field GPS location of any use inside the park during 2 years. Thematic vector maps for each land cover, zoning area, and observed use were created. Maps of zoning and uses were overlapped and new maps for each use-zoning crossing were created. The park contain nine different zoning areas wherein 28 different uses were identified, 18 of them were direct consumptive and non-consumptive uses, occurring on 54% of the park. Tourism transit areas were the most used zones. More than 5,000 people use the park during a high season day. Superimposition of zoning maps with actual use data produced 13 uses taking place in not allowed areas (46% of park area). Most common prohibited use was commercial net fishing, occurring in nearly 40% of the park area. Therefore, identifying human use conflicts and its geographical distribution is a key issue to improve Management Plans as well as identifying hot sites. The GPS-GIS methodology presented here allows Park Rangers to select those areas which could benefit from enhanced supervision with the limited budget available.																	1400-0350					MAR	2012	16	1					65	76		10.1007/s11852-011-0170-3								WOS:000300888500007						
J	Al Kwatli, MA; Gillot, PY; Al Gharib, I; Lefevre, JC				Al Kwatli, Mohamad Amer; Gillot, Pierre Yves; Al Gharib, Iyad; Lefevre, Jean Claude			Integration of K-Ar geochronology and remote sensing: Mapping volcanic rocks and constraining the timing of alteration processes (Al-Lajat Plateau, Syria)	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												The Al-Lajat plateau (southern Syria) is a Quaternary volcanic field hosting numerous historical and archaeological sites. Based on the integration of K-Ar geochronology and remote sensing methods, a new map is presented for Al-Lajat plateau volcanic field, and a chronological model for alteration processes (such as weathering) in relation to Quaternary paleoclimatic changes. Potential use of the geological data in archaeological investigations is discussed. The alteration patterns of ferric, ferrous, and clay minerals were identified by using Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper data (ETM+) methods and ratio images of 3/1, 5/4 and 5/7. Principal Components Analysis (PCA), combined with "Crosta technique" interpretation was used to gauge the response of weathered minerals. Using this technique, high concentrations of ferrous minerals appear brightly colored in the third axis of the Principal Components Analysis ('PC3'), while oxides show the opposite in PC4. Composite images consisting of ratio images (3/1, 4/5, and 5/7), shown in blue, green, and red respectively, appear to be the most useful for mapping the lithologic boundaries of the main lava flows. Based on new K-Ar ages, the timing of the volcanic activity appears to have been between 56 +/- 9 ka and 266 +/- 6 ka. Three distinct groups of ages can be identified, confirming the sequence of the basaltic units defined by remote sensing: 1) the youngest unit belongs to Tyrrhenian, between 71 ka and 56 ka, 2) the intermediate unit, Pre-Tyrrhenian to Tyrrhenian between 114 ka and 139 ka, and 3) the oldest basaltic unit, surrounding the Al-Lajat plateau, is dated to at least 266 ka. A chrono-alteration model highlights the role of climatic changes in the distribution of the minerals at the surface of the volcanic rocks as a function of the ages. Weathering conditions during the post-glaciation phase are responsible for clay removal in the study area. Integrating dating and remote sensing data are important for mapping the location and timing of past volcanic activity, but can also be used to identify the sources of archaeological tools and architecture in volcanic areas such as the Al-Lajat plateau.

In the Saemangeum area on the west coast of Korea, construction of a huge tidal dyke for land reclamation has strongly influenced the coastal environment. This study used remotely sensed data to analyze the SS changes in coastal waters caused by the dyke construction. Landsat and MODIS satellite images were used for the spatial analysis of finer patterns and for the detailed temporal analysis, respectively. Forty Landsat scenes and 105 monthly composite MODIS images observed during 1985-2010 were employed, and four field campaigns (from 2005 to 2006) were performed to verify the image-derived SS. The results of the satellite data analyses showed that the seawater was clear before the dyke construction, with SS values lower than 20 g/m(3). These values increased continuously as the dyke construction progressed. The maximum SS values appeared just before completion of the fourth dyke. Values decreased to below 5 g/m(3) after dyke construction. These changes indicated tidal current modification. Some eddies and plumes were observed in the images generated from Landsat data. Landsat and MODIS can reveal that coastal water turbidity was greatly reduced after completion of the construction. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The first complete inventory of the local glaciers and ice caps on Greenland	CRYOSPHERE												Glacier inventories provide essential baseline information for the determination of water resources, glacier-specific changes in area and volume, climate change impacts as well as past, potential and future contribution of glaciers to sea-level rise. Although Greenland is heavily glacierised and thus highly relevant for all of the above points, a complete inventory of its glaciers was not available so far. Here we present the results and details of a new and complete inventory that has been compiled from more than 70 Landsat scenes (mostly acquired between 1999 and 2002) using semi-automated glacier mapping techniques. A digital elevation model (DEM) was used to derive drainage divides from watershed analysis and topographic attributes for each glacier entity. To serve the needs of different user communities, we assigned to each glacier one of three connectivity levels with the ice sheet (CL0, CL1, CL2; i.e. no, weak, and strong connection) to clearly, but still flexibly, distinguish the local glaciers and ice caps (GIC) from the ice sheet and its outlet glaciers. In total, we mapped similar to 20 300 glaciers larger than 0.05 km(2) (of which similar to 900 are marine terminating), covering an area of 130 076 +/- 4032 km(2), or 89 720 +/- 2781 km(2) without the CL2 GIC. The latter value is about 50% higher than the mean value of more recent previous estimates. Glaciers smaller than 0.5 km(2) contribute only 1.5% to the total area but more than 50% (11 000) to the total number. In contrast, the 25 largest GIC (> 500 km(2)) contribute 28% to the total area, but only 0.1% to the total number. The mean elevation of the GIC is 1700m in the eastern sector and around 1000m otherwise. The median elevation increases with distance from the coast, but has only a weak dependence on mean glacier aspect.

Glacier dynamics over the last quarter of a century at Helheim, Kangerdlugssuaq and 14 other major Greenland outlet glaciers	CRYOSPHERE												The Greenland ice sheet is experiencing increasing rates of mass loss, the majority of which results from changes in discharge from tidewater glaciers. Both atmospheric and ocean drivers have been implicated in these dynamic changes, but understanding the nature of the response has been hampered by the lack of measurements of glacier flow rates predating the recent period of warming. Here, using Landsat-5 data from 1985 onwards, we extend back in time the record of surface velocities and ice-front position for 16 of Greenland's fastest-flowing tidewater glaciers, and compare these to more recent data from Landsat-7 and satellite-borne synthetic-aperture radar. Climate re-analysis data and sea surface temperatures from 1982 show that since 1995 most of Greenland and its surrounding oceans have experienced significant overall warming, and a switch to a warming trend. During the period from 1985 to 1995 when Greenland and the surrounding oceans were not warming, major tidewater outlet glaciers around Greenland, including Kangerdlugssuaq and Helheim, were dynamically stable. Since the mid-1990s, glacier discharge has consistently been both greater and more variable. Together, these observations support the hypothesis that recent dynamic change is a rapid response to climate forcing. Both air and ocean temperatures in this region are predicted to continue to warm, and will therefore likely drive further change in outlet glacier discharge.

The map (available at http://www.transmap.fc.ul.pt/) was a reference for the study of environmental and social aspects, and for conservation, was disseminated among local stakeholders, ENGOs and various decision-making authorities and managers, and was used in the development of a transfrontier conservation area. Large scale remote sensing constitutes a cost-effective approach for research and management, as, with limited human, technical, temporal, and financial resources, it provides synoptic views of territories and allows for the estimation of quantitative changes in land use.

Multi-decadal marine- and land-terminating glacier recession in the Ammassalik region, southeast Greenland	CRYOSPHERE												Landsat imagery was applied to elucidate glacier fluctuations of land- and marine-terminating outlet glaciers from the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) and local land-terminating glaciers and ice caps (GIC) peripheral to the GrIS in the Ammassalik region, Southeast Greenland, during the period 1972-2011. Data from 21 marine-terminating glaciers (including the glaciers Helheim, Midgaard, and Fenris), the GrIS land-terminating margin, and 35 GIC were examined and compared to observed atmospheric air temperatures, precipitation, and reconstructed ocean water temperatures (at 400 m depth in the Irminger Sea). Here, we document that net glacier recession has occurred since 1972 in the Ammassalik region for all glacier types and sizes, except for three GIC. The land-terminating GrIS and GIC reflect lower marginal and areal changes than the marine-terminating outlet glaciers. The mean annual land-terminating GrIS and GIC margin recessions were about three to five times lower than the GrIS marine-terminating recession. The marine-terminating outlet glaciers had an average net frontal retreat for 1999-2011 of 0.098 km yr(-1), which was significantly higher than in previous sub-periods 1972-1986 and 1986-1999. For the marine-terminating GrIS, the annual areal recession rate has been decreasing since 1972, while increasing for the land-terminating GrIS since 1986. On average for all the observed GIC, a mean net frontal retreat for 1986-2011 of 0.010 +/- 0.006 km yr(-1) and a mean areal recession of around 1% per year occurred; overall for all observed GIC, a mean recession rate of 27 +/- 24% occurred based on the 1986 GIC area. Since 1986, five GIC melted away in the Ammassalik area.

It is the largest continuous area of the Atlantic Forest remaining in the country and this biome is among the most threatened ones in the world. This area covers the north coast of the state and includes several conservation units of different categories, and the Environmental Protection Area of Guaraquecaba, is the largest one. The objective of this study was to analyze the landscape structure (matrix and patches) of the National Park of Superagui, and its buffer zone. The classification of land cover and the definition of the attributes of the area and perimeter were made using a digital image Landsat 5 TM. According to the landscape structure analysis, it was observed that the Park matrix is formed by native vegetation interrupted by the presence of patches. Approximately 7% of the studied area is composed by fragments, which belong to class of changed vegetation, exposed soil, urban areas, sand and water; mostly have less than one hectare and have a regular shape. The Park buffer zone is not fully incorporated within the limits of Environmental Protection Area of Guaraquecaba, where marine areas form a great portion. It follows that landscape structure analysis, through its structural components matrix and patches, is an efficient subsidy to verify the park land cover functionality and its buffer zone.																	0103-9954					JAN-MAR	2012	22	1					23	33										WOS:000305146000003

In this study we assessed spatial variability and temporal dynamics of benthic habitat types in a relatively turbid northeastern Baltic Sea coastal environment using the space-borne multispectral sensor QuickBird. Seven broad habitat classes were defined for the study area representing the most typical habitats of the coastal environment. The studied classes were bare sand, the brown alga Fucus vesiculosus, hard bottom with ephemeral algae, higher-order plants and/or charophytes on soft bright bottom, dense higher-order plant habitats, and drifting algal mats and deep water (>3m). Two QuickBird images acquired over a 3 year interval (2005 to 2008) of Western-Estonian archipelago were processed and change detection analysis applied. Although there was a relatively large scatter in reflectance variability within each habitat type, the analyses allowed a clear differentiation of most habitat types. Exceptions were the lack of statistical differences among deep water, drifting algae, and dense higher-order plant communities, as well as among low density higher-order plant and algal communities. Major changes in the spatial patterns of benthic habitats occurred in hydrodynamically active areas. Differences in water properties caused some confusion in classification and therefore resulted in inaccuracies in maps of change. Thus, the used broad habitat classes represent the limit of the method and the multispectral sensors do not allow finer elements of habitats to be captured.

Evaluation of space adequateness of shrimp farms in Southern Brazil	ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS												In Rio Grande do Sul State, there are four marine shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) farms in the municipal districts of Sao Jose do Norte and Rio Grande, and other four with previous license for operation. Thus, the present study aimed to identify and characterize areas for marine shrimp farming located in the Southern portion of the Patos Lagoon estuary (32 degrees 00'S 52 degrees 00'W) by employing the analysis of satellite remote sensing (Landsat TM and ETM+/Google Earth), airborne remote sensing (35mm system ADAR 1000), terrestrial remote sensing (RICOH 500SE), and field expeditions, integrating data in a Geographical Information System (IDRISI Andes). As a result, the enterprises were built on coastal fields or in obliterated dune areas, which are favorable for cultivation. The proximity of possible consuming markets and local labor, relatively good access roads and local technical support also favor the projects. However, there must be caution in terms of changes in the original projects, which could cause environmental impacts and noncompliance of environmental norms, such as the occupation of salt marsh areas. Based on the obtained information, instruments can be created to help inherent legal decision-making to manage the activity for futures enterprises.				freitas, rodrigo/H-3130-2011	Poersch, Luis/0000-0002-1663-6252; Digorandow, Rodrigo Randow de Freitas/0000-0003-0170-6892												0001-3765					SEP	2011	83	3					1069	1076		10.1590/S0001-37652011005000024								WOS:000294126600025	21808923					
J	Yang, W; Matsushita, B; Chen, J; Fukushima, T				Yang, Wei; Matsushita, Bunkei; Chen, Jin; Fukushima, Takehiko			Estimating constituent concentrations in case II waters from MERIS satellite data by semi-analytical model optimizing and look-up tables	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Remote estimation of water constituent concentrations in case II waters has been a great challenge, primarily due to the complex interactions among the phytoplankton, tripton, colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and pure water. Semi-analytical algorithms for estimating constituent concentrations are effective and easy to implement, but two challenges remain. First, a dataset without a sampling bias is needed to calibrate estimation models; and second, the semi-analytical indices were developed based on several specific assumptions that may not be universally applicable. In this study, a semi-analytical model-optimizing and look-up-table (SAMO-LUT) method was proposed to address these two challenges. The SAMO-LUT method is based on three previous semi-analytical models to estimate chlorophyll a, tripton and CDOM. Look-up tables and an iterative searching strategy were used to obtain the most appropriate parameters in the models. Three datasets (i.e., noise-free simulation data, in situ data and Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) satellite data) were collected to validate the performance of the proposed method. The results show that the SAMO-LUT method yields error-free results for the ideal simulation dataset; and is able also to accurately estimate the water constituent concentrations with an average bias (mean normalized bias, MNB) lower than 9% and relative random uncertainty (normalized root mean square error, NRMS) lower than 34% even for in situ and MERIS data. These results demonstrate the potential of the proposed algorithm to accurately monitor inland and coastal waters based on satellite observations. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Darwish, MAG				Darwish, Mohamed Abdallah Gad			Geochemical reconnaissance survey and environmental assessment for stream sediments of Wadi Um Gier, Southeastern Desert, Egypt	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The purposes of this study were to assess the influence of old mining activities on the geochemistry and quality of sediments and to identify the sites of economic elements. Thirty sites of stream sediment were sampled in the study area covered by granitic, metarhyodacitic and meta-andesitic rocks and related tuffs-hosted abandoned Au mine. The suite of chemical elements, Ag, Bi, Cd, Cu, Fe, Ga, Hg, Mn, Nb, Pb, Rb, Sb, Se, Sn, Te, Th, U, Y, Zn and Zr, pH value and total organic carbon were determined, and univariate, bivariate and multivariate statistical methods were applied. The results show that the enrichment factor (EF) is very high in the case of Te and significant also with respect to Ag, Bi, Cu, Sb, Se, Sn and Zn. Likewise, geoaccumulation indices (Igeos) varied from very highly polluted with Sn and Te, strongly to very strongly polluted with Bi and Se, and moderately polluted with Sb. The polluted sites of Ag, Bi, Sb, Se, Sn and Te were outlined using Igeos maps, and economic sites of Ag and Sn were identified by geochemical maps leading to their sources, which are likely to be mining activities and lithogenic processes. The pollutant elements may cause toxicity in stream sediments, or surface or underground water, as well as plants and animals in the area. This investigation provides an environmental baseline for future monitoring of possible human/anthropogenic, industrial and agricultural impacts on the study area and considers an attempt at re-mining Ag and Sn.																	1866-6280					FEB	2011	62	3					657	672		10.1007/s12665-010-0555-x								WOS:000286193200017

Seven geomorphologic units were recognized, these being: recent shore ridges and marine beaches, schist and phyllite highlands, limestone highlands, foot slopes, alluvial fans, young alluvial plains and drainage basins. The data were integrated with topographic maps covering the area by using GIS tools. Contour lines were used to generate a digital terrain model (DTM) of the area. The DTM was processed to generate shaded relief. A Landsat 7 ETM satellite image was draped on the DTM to display the spatial scope of the investigated area. For the purpose of creating a soil map 15 observation points were dug representing the different physiographic units belonging to the study area. Soil mapping units have been identified by integrating physiographic units, field survey observations, morphologic description and laboratory analyses. Seven soil taxonomic units have been recognized, namely: Typic Xeropsamments, Aquic Xeropsamments, Typic Xerofluvents, Aquic Haploxerepts, Typic Xerorthents, Typic Calcixerepts and Fluventic Haploxerepts. Physiographic and soil maps with a scale of 1:25.000 were produced.																	1392-3196						2011	98	1					93	104										WOS:000291072600012						
J	Howat, IM; Eddy, A				Howat, Ian M.; Eddy, Alex			Multi-decadal retreat of Greenland's marine-terminating glaciers	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												Many marine-terminating glaciers draining the Greenland ice sheet have retreated over the past decade, yet the extent and magnitude of retreat relative to past variability is unknown. We measure changes in front positions of 210 marine-terminating glaciers using Landsat imagery spanning nearly four decades and compare decadal-scale rates of change with earlier observations. We find that 90% of the observed glaciers retreated between 2000 and 2010, approaching 100% in the northwest, with rapid retreat observed in all sectors of the ice sheet. The current retreat is accelerating and likely began between 1992 and 2000, coincident with the onset of warming, following glacier stability and minor advance during a mid-century cooling period. While it is clear an extensive retreat occurred in the early 20th century, a period of increasing air temperatures, a comparison of our results with historical observations provides evidence that the current retreat is more widespread. The onset of rapid retreat with warming relative to the slow and lagged advance with cooling suggests an asymmetry in the response of marine fronts to external forcing.

According to our data, the Comoro islands are inhabited by two amphibian species and at least 28 species of reptiles although ongoing genetic studies and unconfirmed historical records suggest an even higher species diversity. 14 of the 28 currently recognized species of terrestrial reptiles (50%) and the two amphibians are endemic to a single island or to the Comoro archipelago. The majority of species are most abundant at low elevation. However, a few endemic species, like the gekkonid lizards Paroedura sanctijohannis and Phelsuma nigristriata, are more common in or even confined to higher altitudes. We created habitat maps from remotely sensed data in combination with detailed species distribution maps produced using comprehensive data from field surveys between 2000 and 2010, literature, and historical locality records based on specimens in zoological collections. Using these data, we assessed the conservation status of the endemic terrestrial reptiles and amphibians according to the IUCN Red List criteria. Our results show that although little area of natural forest remains on the Comoros, many species are abundant in degraded forest or plantations. Competition and predation by invasive species appears to be the most important threat factor for the endemic herpetofauna, together with habitat degradation and destruction, which further favours invasive species. We propose the status Endangered for three species, Vulnerable for one species, Near Threatened for six species, Least Concern for four and Data Deficient for two species. The endemic subspecies Oplurus cuvieri comorensis is proposed for the status Critically Endangered. Based on the results of this study, seven areas of importance for reptile and amphibian conservation on the Comoros are identified. This study shows how remote sensing data can contribute to increasing accuracy and objectiveness of conservation assessments.																	1313-2989	1313-2970					2011		144					21	79		10.3897/zookeys.144.1648								WOS:000299592100002	22207785

J.; Hedley, John D.; Sotheran, Ian			Combining optical and acoustic data to enhance the detection of Caribbean forereef habitats	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Maps of coral reef habitats are fundamental tools for reef management, and high map accuracy is desirable to support appropriate decisions, such as the stratification of marine reserves by habitat class. While satelite sensors have been used to map different reef communities, the accuracy of these maps tends to be low (overall accuracy<50%) and optical airborne methods with high spectral resolution have, to date, been the most effective (if expensive) means of achieving higher accuracy. A potential means of compensating for the low spectral and radiometric resolution of optical satellite data, which is a major cause of its poor performance, is to combine satellite data with acoustic remote sensing. This study quantified the benefit of the synergy between optical satellite data (IKONOS) and acoustic (RoxAnn) sensors. The addition of acoustic data provided three new data axes for discriminating habitats: seabed roughness (E1), reef depth (z) and the depth correction of satellite spectral data to uniform depth. Seabed hardness (E2) was not an informative channel in our study. The use of z to conduct the water-column correction of the optical bands to uniform depth is a potential improvement over applying the depth-invariant index approach to optical data in the absence of ancillary information on depth. Habitat maps of the forereef of Glovers Atoll (Belize, Central America) were created using k-means unsupervised classification on eleven different treatment images constructed from various combinations of optical and acoustic data layers. The maximum benefit of data synergy was achieved by depth correcting the optical bands. The accuracy of maps based on the depth-invariant optical index was not enhanced when E1, E2 or z were added as separate layers but was enhanced when these three acoustic measures were added in concert. Data synergy can improve the accuracy of habitat maps and the availability of both data sets allows practitioners to take advantage of each techniques' additional strengths such as providing synoptic continuous imagery for education and general management planning (in the case of optical imagery) and maps of reef rugosity (in the case of acoustic data).

The study was based on analyzing two satellite images Landsat-TM, taken in 1999 and 2003 and the database composed by the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) marine data/observations taken in August, September, and October of 1999, 2000 and 2001. The methodology consists of four phases: 1) a geographical study of Kuwait Bay; 2) statistical analysis of the biophysical indicator database; 3) satellite imagery processing using RS techniques; and finally 4) Integration of RS results with biophysical indicator database using GIS techniques. The first phase revealed that Kuwait Bay has suffered from many environmental challenges. Phase two pointed out that SST has exceeded the maximum standard average, while DO at the opposite exceeded the minimum standard average. The third phase, analyzing images using ERDAS Imagine software, produced two land use/cover maps for 1999 and 2003 with statistical inventory of land use. Changes occurrINGed between 1999 and 2003 were estimated using ArcGIS software. The same process was replased using image differencing technique, proving deep water areas have decreased and shallow water areas increased in the south of Kuwait Bay. These specific areas are characterized also by high SST and low DO, and simultaneously correspond to locations of fish kill accidents happening in 1999 due to "Red Tide" and in of 2001 due to "Streptococcus Bacteria". In conclusion, the study proved integrating GIS and RS techniques, along with biophysical indicators suitable for handling and monitoring the fish kill phenomenon in Kuwait Bay																	1015-4442					JUN	2010	28	2					126	+										WOS:000288405300006

Measuring progress toward global marine conservation targets	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT												Marine species and their habitats are facing widespread overexploitation and degradation, respectively. In response to urgent calls for their protection, the international community agreed to establish representative networks of marine protected areas by 2012 that would conserve and protect 10-30% of specific habitats. To achieve these goals will require reliable estimates of the total area occupied by each habitat. We evaluated this assumption for coral reefs by generating estimates of coral reef area from high-spatial-resolution, remotely sensed imagery (30-m resolution Landsat data), and comparing these with existing published data (usually >1-km resolution). Discrepancies between previous estimates and our values ranged from +1316% to -64%. This uncertainty is incompatible with realistic achievement of the 10-30% conservation targets. We conclude that currently available estimates of the global extent of most coastal marine habitats are based on data that are too poorly resolved to be useful in evaluating progress toward the 2012 targets. Most countries will therefore be unable to demonstrate that they have fulfilled their commitments to marine biodiversity conservation. We urge that accurate inventories be conducted, in a cost-effective fashion, through analyses of available high-spatial-resolution satellite imagery.																	1540-9295					APR	2010	8	3					124	129		10.1890/080109								WOS:000276634200017

Here, we investigated the effect of phytoplankton composition on the SDA based on the tank experiments using cultured samples for five phytoplankton species (three cyanobacteria, one green algae and one diatom) and lake water samples collected from Lake Kasumigaura from September 2004 to August 2005 except for April 2005. The results showed that the SDA-based models obtained from the cultured samples (culture-based models) showed high accuracies for Chl-a and NPSS estimations in all phytoplankton species (root mean square error [RMSE] about 16.2 mu g l(-1) for Chl-a and about 11.0 mg l(-1) for NPSS). However, the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) band combinations, which gave the smallest RMSE of the Chl-a and NPSS estimations, differed among the species. In addition, the culture-based models could apply to lake water samples with similar accuracies if the optimal standard reflectance spectra (SRS) of end-members in the water body could be determined. This implies the potential of the SDA-based model as follows: (1) it is less site-and time-specific compared with conventional empirical methods (single band, band ratio, and arithmetic band calculation); (2) it can be proposed by a tank experiment or by a simulation using bio-optical modelling.

Ezz			Spectral enhancement of SPOT imagery data to assess marine pollution near Port Said, Egypt	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Satellite image data were used to detect, monitor and map different pollutants at five study sites along the El-Gamil beach, including El-Debba, El-Manasra, El-Fardous and El-Gamil inlets and the El-Gamil airport. The images were rectified and analysed by ERDAS IMAGINE 8.7. Image processing techniques were applied using ENVI 4.2 to analyse the SPOT image data (10 m resolution) for 2006. Image enhancement, principal component analysis (PCA), band ratios and supervised/unsupervised classifications were applied. Surface water samples were collected during the winter of 2005 and the summer of 2006. Water contamination was found to be higher in the summer than in the winter. SPOT image data from the summer, therefore, was selected to verify the results of metal analysis. Different pollutants detected along the El Manasra and El Debba sites are associated with industrial development, and discharge from natural gas companies and electric power generating stations. Significant water pollution is not unique to this region of the Mediterranean Sea, but is increasingly common at coastal locations throughout the globe. To protect both the marine environment and commercial interests that depend on clean water and beaches (e. g. beach resorts), effective wastewater management practices must be designed, implemented and maintained, along with reasonable development policies. Remote sensing may be an important tool for monitoring the effectiveness of any pollution mitigation strategies.

AD) and supported a branch of the Via Egnatia road. However, few studies have considered the environmental context of the construction of the bridge. and until now, only two hypotheses have been presented: The bridge was built on or over a junction of the Aliakmon and Loudias Rivers, or on a coastal barrier. Within the framework of a geoarchaeological project developed in April 2008, five boreholes were drilled and the sediment cores analysed for microfauna and sedimentology. Seven (14)C AMS dates provided a chronostratigraphic sequence and helped to define the geomorphological evolution of the area. Spatial interpretation of the results was possible using a Landsat TM image (False Colour Composite - FCC). Our data indicate the gradual transition of the site from a marine to a terrestrial environment during Ancient Times. Lagoonal conditions dominated during the construction of the bridge and the presence of a palaeochannel of the Aliakmon River was later revealed (transition from Byzantine and Ottoman periods), overlying sediments of a coastal barrier.

The regional land use is dominated by sugarcane cultivation, beef grazing and urban uses. The high nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) fluxes from these land uses via river runoff produced a massive phytoplankton bloom in the GBR lagoon, which, after 9 days, had spread 150 km offshore. The plume and algal bloom surrounded inner-shelf reefs of the GBR such as Brampton Island Reef and its spread was tracked with a variety of satellite sensors including MODIS, SeaWiFS and Landsat over the 9-day period. The ability to be able to access imagery from a large number of satellite sensors allowed almost daily estimates of the extent of plume to be made, despite periods of cloud. Analysis of water samples from the plume revealed elevated (2-50 times higher) concentrations of Chlorophyll a (and hence phytoplankton biomass), up to 50 times higher than in non-flood conditions, nutrients (2-100 times higher) and herbicide residues (10-100 times higher) compared with GBR lagoon waters in non-discharge conditions. The concentration data from the samples and estimated exposure periods from the satellite images allowed estimates of the exposure of GBR marine ecosystems (coral reefs, the pelagic community, seagrass beds and mangrove forests) to the terrestrial contaminants to be made.

Land Use Dynamics in a Marine Protected Area System in Lower Andaman Coast of Thailand, 1990-2005	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												This study has depicted a scenario on assessing spatial and temporal land use/cover changes in and adjacent to marine protected areas (MPA) in a study site in Thailand. The measurement of landscape stability and its implications for protection and conservation of coastal resources are emphasized in this study. The methods employed include interpretation and analysis of satellite images, aerial photographs, and geographic information system (GIS) data. Image analysis and GIS techniques have been used extensively, and a site-specific geospatial database was developed accordingly. Initial temporal changes inside and outside protected areas are captured from visual interpretation of three time series satellite images, where an increase of aquaculture ponds and abandoned areas is clearly visible. The output changes derived from the image differencing techniques demonstrated considerable changes in the whole study area as well as inside the protected area boundary during 1976 to 1990. Compared to the earlier time (1976-1990) the changes during 1990 to 2005 are found to be less extensive. Although the existing marine protected areas were declared earlier than the 1990s, the changes are still found inside the protected area boundary during 1990-2005. The result shows significant increases in agriculture areas, including aquaculture development, which are, however, less inside the protected areas than the buffer areas. While mangrove areas have noticeable negative changes, an increase in Malalueca forest areas is interesting. In the discussion, a quantitative comparison of legislative boundary and buffer effects on protecting land use and land cover is illustrated. In light of existing ecological context and socioeconomic activities, observations are made on agents of change and resource use conflicts.																	0749-0208					SEP	2009	25	5					1082	1095		10.2112/08-1058.1								WOS:000270369500002						
J	Nagler, PL; Glenn, EP; Hinojosa-Huerta, O				Nagler, Pamela L.; Glenn, Edward P.; Hinojosa-Huerta, Osvel			Synthesis of ground and remote sensing data for monitoring ecosystem functions in the Colorado River Delta, Mexico	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The delta of the Colorado River in Mexico supports a rich mix of estuarine, wetland and riparian ecosystems that provide habitat for over 350 species of birds as well as fish, marine mammals, and other wildlife. An important part of the delta ecosystem is the riparian corridor, which is supported by agricultural return flows and waste spills of water originating in the U.S. and Mexico. These flows may be curtailed in the future due to climate change and changing land use practices (out-of-basin water transfers, increased agricultural efficiency, and more optimal management of dams) in the U.S. and Mexico, and resource managers need to monitor the effects of their water management practices on these ecosystems. We developed ground-validated, remote sensing methods to monitor the vegetation status, habitat value, and water use of wetland and riparian ecosystems using multi-temporal, multi-resolution images. The integrated methodology allowed us to project species composition, leaf area index, fractional cover, habitat value, and evapotranspiration over seasons and years throughout the delta, in response to variable water flows from the U.S. to Mexico. Waste spills of water from the U.S. have regenerated native cottonwood and willow trees in the riparian corridor and created backwater and marsh areas that support birds and other wildlife. However, the main source of water supporting the riparian vegetation is the regional aquifer recharged by underflow from U.S. and Mexico irrigation districts. Native trees have a short half-life in the riparian zone due to human-set fires and harvesting for timber. Active management, monitoring, and restoration programs are needed to maintain the habitat value of this ecosystem for the future.

Analysis of cover change (1995-2005) of Tanzania/Mozambique trans-boundary mangroves using Landsat imagery	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS					5th Western-Indian-Ocean-Marine-Science-Association Symposium (WIOMSA)	OCT 22-26, 2007	Durban, SOUTH AFRICA	Western Indian Ocean Marine Sci Assoc, Oceanog Res Inst				1. Despite the ecological, environmental, and economic importance of mangroves, they are declining at an alarming rate worldwide, mostly as a result of human activities. 2. Along the eastern African coast, Mozambique has the largest mangrove area. Fishing and farming are the main economic activities in the area, and people harvest mangrove vegetation for tannins, fuel wood, traditional medicine, boat-building, carpentry, and crafting. 3. Landsat 5 TM imagery was used to map the distribution of trans-boundary mangrove areas along the Mtwara-Quirimbas Complex. Results for 1995 and 2005 are presented for the entire coastline and in more detail for the Ruvuma estuary, Quiterajo, Ibo/Quirimba islands, and Pemba Bay. Results were validated with a ground-truthing excursion in 2006, showing an overall thematic accuracy of 73%. 4. Total estimated area of mangrove was 357 km(2) in 1995 and 368 km(2) in 2005, with the small net gain of 3% corresponding to a total gain of 32 km(2) and a total loss of 21 km(2) over this decade. 5. Results suggest that although Landsat TM imagery can be effective in mapping mangrove distribution, caution must be used in inferring its ecological condition.

A combinated approach to investigate the biochemistry and hydrography of a shallow bay in the South Adriatic Sea: the Gulf of Manfredonia (Italy)	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The main goal of this study is to understand the hydrological and biochemical set up and processes of a marine coastal area located in the western side of the south Adriatic sea (the gulf of Manfredonia) by the use of both satellite images and in situ investigations A water sampling in the gulf of Manfredonia was performed at 18 fixed stations in June 2003; physico-chemical and biological parameters (temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen and fluorescence) were measured along the water column and water samples were collected to analyse dissolved nutrients (ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, phosphate and silicate), total nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus), chlorophyll a and total suspended solids. Surface spatial distributions of field collected data were examined to characterize biochemical and hydrographic conditions of the Gulf of Manfredonia and these results were related with the remote sensing analysis data. Remote sensed data (obtained by Landsat 7 TM and Modis Terra) were processed to obtain maps of chlorophyll a, temperature and optical characteristics of the gulf; these maps were compared to in situ data. From physico-chemical measurements no stratification was observed in the water column except for the south-eastern area. High concentrations of silicate and ammonia were observed in the northern zone of the gulf, while nitrate, phosphate, chlorophyll a and total suspended solids distributions showed higher values in the central coastal zone. These results were confirmed by remote sensing analysis; Modis elaboration showed a distribution with higher concentrations of chlorophyll a near the coast and Landsat images highlighted the extension of the surrounding agricultural areas crossed by the two main rivers which discharge into the gulf. The integration between field data with the remote sensing analysis showed to be a valid support in coastal zone management.

An Integrated Field and Remote Sensing Approach for Mapping Seagrass Cover, Moreton Bay, Australia	JOURNAL OF SPATIAL SCIENCE												Creating accurate maps of seagrass cover is a challenging procedure in coastal waters with variable water clarity and depths. This paper presents an approach for mapping seagrass cover from data sources commonly collected by natural resource management agencies responsible for coastal environments. The aim of the study was to develop an approach for mapping classes of seagrass cover from field and/or image data for an area with variable water clarity and depths. The study was carried out in Moreton Bay in eastern Australia. A Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper satellite image was acquired for the same area in August 2004. The image data were used to map seagrass cover in the exposed inter-tidal and clear shallow water areas to depths of 3 in. Field Survey data were collected, in July - August 2004, to map deep (> 3 m) and turbid sub-tidal areas, using: real time video, snorkeller observations and transect Surveys. The resulting maps were combined into a single layer of polygons, with the same seagrass cover classes used as existing mapping programs and with each polygon assigned to one of five cover classes (0 %, 1-25 %, 25-50 %, 50-75 %, 75-100 %). As independent field data were not available for accuracy assessment, a reliability assessment indicated that > 75 percent of the Bay was mapped with high categorical reliability. Most previously published seagrass mapping projects covered areas < 400 km(2), were based on single data sets, and lacked assessment of accuracy or reliability. Our approach and methods address this gap and present guidelines for a generally applicable method to integrate image and field data sets over large areas (> 1000 km(2)) commonly used for monitoring and management.

Application of remote sensing to site characterisation and environmental change analysis of North African coastal lagoons	HYDROBIOLOGIA												This article describes the use of satellite imagery for identifying key environmental characteristics within three North African coastal lagoons (Merja Zerga, Morocco; Ghar El Melh, Tunisia and Lake Manzala, Egypt) and for detecting the major environmental changes within these environments. A combination of Landsat MSS, Landsat TM, Landsat ETM+ and ASTER imagery was acquired for the three sites for a period covering the last three decades (1972-2004). Following geometric correction and enhancement, the interpretation of the most recent image acquired for each of the three lagoons provides important insights into their current conditions. For Merja Zerga, these include the distribution of the largest channels which drain extensive inter-tidal mudflats and the two major depositional features associated with sources of freshwater. The distribution of marginal aquatic vegetation is highlighted as is the intensive use of the surrounding landscape for agriculture. Intensive agriculture around Ghar El Melh is also indicated. The influence of the Mejerda River, which was diverted away from the lagoon over 100 years ago, is shown to persist as a residual area of deltaic deposits in shallow water that has been eroded over time. Coastal processes including the direction of the alongshore sediment transport and the influence of engineering work associated with port construction can also be recognised. Within Lake Manzala, vegetated islands divide the lake into a series of sub-basins which can be clearly distinguished. The large influence of human activities within this lake can be identified and include reclamation for agriculture and the conversion of parts of the lake bed for fish farms. The historical images available for the three lagoons provide important insights into decadal scale changes, which have been greatest at Lake Manzala. Since the early 1970s large parts of the lake, in particular in the southwest where the shoreline has migrated northwards, have been reclaimed. Major engineering works, such as the El Salam Canal and road embankments, are shown to have resulted in significant lake change. The distribution of emergent vegetation within the lake has also changed. Classification of images for this lake into open water, vegetation and land enables the quantification of these changes. Between 1973 and 2003, the lake declined in area by approximately 50%. Changes at Merja Zerga over the last three decades include reconfiguration of the marine outlet and the expansion of the internal delta at the end of the Nador Canal. The images of this site clearly demonstrate the intensification of agriculture around the lagoon. The most marked changes evident within the images of Ghar El Melh concern the sand bars that separate the lagoon from the sea. Geomorphological processes operating within the coastal zone have resulted in the straightening of the bars with central sections migrating out towards the sea. Remote sensing is established as a promising application for detecting the quantitative surface cover changes in coastal lagoons and their near landscapes.

Morphology and modern sedimentary deposits of the macrotidal Marapanim Estuary (Amazon, Brazil)	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												The northern Brazilian coast, east of the Amazon River is characterized by several macrotidal estuarine systems that harbor large mangrove areas with approximately 7600 km(2). The Marapanim Estuary is influenced by macrotidal regime with moderate waves influence. Morphologic units were investigated by using remote sensing images (i.e., Landsat-7 ETM+, RADARSAT-1 Wide and SRTM) integrated with bathymetric data. The modern sedimentary deposits were analyzed from 67 cores collected by Vibracore and Rammkersonde systems. Analysis of morphology and surface sedimentary deposits of the Marapanim River reveal they are strongly influenced by the interaction of tidal, wave and fluvial currents. Based on these processes it was possible to recognize three distinct longitudinal facies zonation that revels the geological filling of a macrotidal estuary. The estuary mouth contain fine to medium marine sands strongly influenced by waves and tides, responsible for macrotidal sandy beaches and estuarine channel development, which are characterized by wave-ripple bedding and longitudinal cross-bedding sands. The estuary funnel is mainly influenced by tides that form wide tidal mudflats, colonized by mangroves, along the estuarine margin, with parallel laminations, lenticular bedding, root fragments and organic matter lenses. The upstream estuary contains coarse sand to gravel of fluvial origin. Massive mud with organic matter lenses, marks and roots fragments occur in the floodplain accumulates during seasonal flooding providing a slowly aggrading in the alluvial plain. This morphologic and depositional pattern show easily a tripartite zonation of a macrotidal estuary, that are in the final stage of filling. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Geomorphology of a dryland fluvial system: the Lower Balonne River, southern Queensland	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												The floodplain of the Lower Balonne River is in the upper reaches of the Murray-Darling Basin. The region has been extensively developed for agriculture, in particular irrigated cotton, and is highly productive. Multidisciplinary investigations to inform land management generated extensive sets of remotely sensed data including Landsat TM, airborne gamma-ray radiometrics, aerial photography, ASTER imagery and digital elevation models. These datasets provided the basis for regolith and geomorphic mapping. The wealth of data has allowed characterisation of the Lower Balonne River system, which is typical of many of the dryland rivers of southern Queensland. The geomorphic map of the Lower Balonne floodplain has eight major units based on landform and geomorphic processes. Bedrock consists of the slightly deformed and extensively weathered marine Cretaceous Griman Creek Formation. Coincident with erosion and weathering, Paleogene quartz gravels were deposited and are now extensively cemented and preserved as remnants forming zones of inverted relief. Much of the present landscape consists of a series of juxtaposed depositional units that have infilled an incised valley system. The different depositional units show the paleo-Balonne River migrating to the west. This is interpreted to be a result of tectonic depression and tilting to the west, causing avulsion and anastomosing of the paleochannels. The modern Balonne River system consists of a number of easily recognised segments. In the north, the modern channel is incised as a single channel. To the south the channel opens out onto an anastomosing plain with branching and reconnecting small-scale channels. Source-bordering dunes, currently inactive, have also formed along the western and eastern sides of the modern river and are prominent in large dunes in the south along the present Moonie River. Their absence in older landscape elements points to increasing aridity over time in the river system.

Identification and characteristics of surge-type glaciers on Novaya Zemlya, Russian Arctic	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												We present a comprehensive new inventory of surge-type glaciers on the Novaya Zemlya archipelago, using high-resolution (up to 4m) satellite imagery from 1976/77 (Hexagon), 1989 (Landsat TM), 2001 (Landsat ETM+) and 2006 (ASTER). A total of 692 glaciers and their forelands were observed for glaciological and geomorphological criteria indicative of glacier surging (e.g. looped moraines, heavy surface crevassing, surface potholes, thrust-block moraines, concertina eskers). This enabled the identification of 32 potential surge-type glaciers (compared with four previously identified) representing 4.6% of the total but 18% by glacier area. We assess the characteristics of surge-type glaciers. Surge-type glaciers are statistically different from non-surge-type glaciers in terms of their area, length, surface slope, minimum elevation, mid-range elevation and terminus type. They are typically long (median length 18.5 km), large (median area 106.8 km(2)) outlet glaciers, with relatively low overall surface slopes (median slope 1.7) and tend to terminate in water (marine or lacustrine). They are predominantly directed towards and located in the more maritime western region of the Russian Arctic, and we suggest that surge occurrence might be related to large and complex catchment areas that receive increased delivery of precipitation from the Barents Sea.

The results of this study provided valuable information to local administrators on the water quality of Kucukcekmece Lake, which is a large water resource of the Istanbul Metropolitan Area. Results also show that such a methodology structured by use of reflectance values provided from satellite imagery, in situ water quality measurements, and basin land use/land cover characteristics obtained from images can serve as a powerful and rapid monitoring tool for the drinking water basins that suffer from rapid urbanization and pollution, all around the world.																	1537-744X						2009	9						1215	1229		10.1100/tsw.2009.135								WOS:000273679300048	19882091					
J	Baker, AC; Glynn, PW; Riegl, B				Baker, Andrew C.; Glynn, Peter W.; Riegl, Bernhard			Climate change and coral reef bleaching: An ecological assessment of long-term impacts, recovery trends and future outlook	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Since the early 1980s, episodes of coral reef bleaching and mortality, due primarily to climate-induced ocean warming, have occurred almost annually in one or more of the world's tropical or subtropical seas. Bleaching is episodic, with the most severe events typically accompanying coupled ocean-atmosphere phenomena, such as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which result in sustained regional elevations of ocean temperature. Using this extended dataset (25+ years), we review the short- and long-term ecological impacts of coral bleaching on reef ecosystems, and quantitatively synthesize recovery data worldwide. Bleaching episodes have resulted in catastrophic loss of coral cover in some locations, and have changed coral community structure in many others, with a potentially critical influence on the maintenance of biodiversity in the marine tropics. Bleaching has also set the stage for other declines in reef health, such as increases in coral diseases, the breakdown of reef framework by bioeroders, and the loss of critical habitat for associated reef fishes and other biota. Secondary ecological effects, such as the concentration of predators on remnant surviving coral populations, have also accelerated the pace of decline in some areas. Although bleaching severity and recovery have been variable across all spatial scales, some reefs have experienced relatively rapid recovery from severe bleaching impacts. There has been a significant overall recovery of coral cover in the Indian Ocean, where many reefs were devastated by a single large bleaching event in 1998. In contrast, coral cover on western Atlantic reefs has generally continued to decline in response to multiple smaller bleaching events and a diverse set of chronic secondary stressors. No clear trends are apparent in the eastern Pacific, the central-southern-western Pacific or the Arabian Gulf, where some reefs are recovering and others are not. The majority of survivors and new recruits on regenerating and recovering coral reefs have originated from broadcast spawning taxa with a potential for asexual growth, relatively long distance dispersal, successful settlement, rapid growth and a capacity for framework construction. Whether or not affected reefs can continue to function as before will depend on: (1) how Much coral cover is lost, and which species are locally extirpated: (2) the ability of remnant and recovering coral communities to adapt or acclimatize to higher temperatures and other climatic factors such as reductions in aragonite saturation state: (3) the changing balance between reef accumulation and bioerosion; and (4) our ability to maintain ecosystem resilience by restoring healthy levels of herbivory, macroalgal cover, and coral recruitment. Bleaching disturbances are likely to become a chronic stress in many reef areas in the coming decades, and coral communities, if they cannot recover quickly enough, are likely to be reduced to their most hardy or adaptable constituents. Some degraded reefs may already be approaching this ecological asymptote, although to date there have not been any global extinctions of individual coral species as a result of bleaching events. Since human populations inhabiting tropical coastal areas derive great value from coral reefs, the degradation of these ecosystems as a result of coral bleaching and its associated impacts is of considerable societal, as well as biological concern. Coral reef conservation strategies now recognize climate change as a principal threat, and are engaged in efforts to allocate conservation activity accrding to geographic-, taxonomic-, and habitat-specific priorities to maximize coral reef survival. Efforts to forecast and monitor bleaching, involving both remote sensed observations and coupled ocean-atmosphere climate models, are also underway. In addition to these efforts, attempts to minimize and mitigate bleaching impacts on reefs are immediately required. If significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions can be achieved within the next two to three decades, maximizing coral survivorship during this time may be critical to ensuring healthy reefs can recover in the long term.

The design of regional networks of marine reserves is concerned with the problem of where to place the marine protected areas and how to spatially configure them. Quantitative methods for doing this provide important decision support tools for marine managers, The central problem is to balance the costs and benefits of the reserve network, whilst satisfying conservation objectives (hence solving a constrained optimization problem). Current optimization algorithms for reserve design are widely used, but none allow for the systematic incorporation of data uncertainty and its effect on the reserve design solutions. The central purpose of this study is to provide a framework for incorporating uncertain ecological input data into algorithms for designing networks of marine reserves. In order to do this, a simplified version of the marine reserve design optimization problem is considered. A Metropolis-Hastings random search procedure is introduced to systematically sample the model solution space and converge on an optimal reserve design. Incorporation of the uncertain input data builds on this process and relies on a parametric bootstrapping procedure. This allows for the solution (i.e, the marine reserve design) to be expressed as the probability of any planning unit being included in the marine reserve network. Spatial plots of this acceptance probability are easily interpretable for decision making under uncertainty. The bootstrapping methodology is also readily adapted to existing comprehensive reserve design algorithms. Here, a preliminary application of the algorithm is made to the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System (in the Caribbean Sea) based on satellite-derived and mapped conservation features (from Landsat).

The rate of the sea-level rise subsequently decelerated, and this bay began to fill with sediments delivered by the Aliakmon and Axios, as well as by other smaller rivers. The palaeogeographic and palaeoenvironmental reconstruction of the Thessaloniki Plain was the focus of several studies published during the past century. Most of these studies are based on the interpretation of historical sources and support the assumption of a fast filling of the bay between the fifth century BC and the fifth century AD. In this work, we first present the results of the analysis of data collected from six boreholes recently drilled in the western part of the plain, up to the western bank of the Axios River. Our study was mainly based on sedimentological and palaeontological analyses and accelerator mass spectrometry and conventional radiocarbon dating of shells and peat. Second, we evaluate the results of this study, as well as of other geological studies, which permit the description of the large-scale stratigraphic pattern of the plain. Data were evaluated on the basis of a geographic information used For the first time in such type of work, and were supplemented and assessed with analysis of Landsat imagery. Based on this evidence, we propose a new, detailed palaeogeographic reconstruction for the evolution of the Thessaloniki Plain during the Late Holocene. This plain corresponded to a wide marine bay during the Neolithic times (6000 BP), and later it was characterised by a fast displacement of the shoreline, mainly during Late Bronze Age, Iron Age, and Classical-Archaic periods (2650-2300 BP). A slowing down of the progradation of the alluvial plain occurred during Roman times (2100-1600 BP), and the plain obtained its present-day topography during the second part of the 20th century.

Quantification of two decades of shallow-water coral reef habitat decline in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary using Landsat data (1984-2002)	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The loss of coral reef habitats has been witnessed at a global scale including in the Florida Keys and the Caribbean. In addition to field surveys that can be spatially limited, remote sensing can provide a synoptic view of the changes occurring on coral reef habitats. Here, we utilize an 18-year time series of Landsat 5/TM and 7/ETM+ images to assess changes in eight coral reef sites in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, namely Carysfort Reef, Grecian Rocks, Molasses Reef, Conch Reef, Sombrero Reef, Looe Key Reef, Western Sambo and Sand Key Reef. Twenty-eight Landsat images (1984-2002) were used, with imagery gathered every 2 years during spring, and every 6 years during fall. The image dataset was georectified, calibrated to remote sensing reflectance and corrected for atmospheric and water-column effects. A Mahalanobis distance classification was trained for four habitat classes ('coral', 'sand', 'bare hardbottom' and 'covered hardbottom') using in situ ground-truthing data collected in 2003-2004 and using the spectral statistics from a 2002 image. The red band was considered useful only for benthic habitats in depths less than 6 m. Overall mean coral habitat loss for all sites classified by Landsat was 61% (3.4%/year), from a percentage habitat cover of 19% (1984) down to 7.6% (2002). The classification results for the eight different sites were critically reviewed. A detailed pixel by pixel examination of the spatial patterns across time suggests that the results range from ecologically plausible to unreliable due to spatial inconsistencies and/or improbable ecological successions. In situ monitoring data acquired by the Coral Reef Evaluation and Monitoring Project (CREMP) for the eight reef sites between 1996 and 2002 showed a loss in coral cover of 52% (8.7%/year), whereas the Landsat-derived coral habitat areas decreased by 37% (6.2%/year). A direct trend comparison between the entire CREMP percent coral cover data set (1996-2004) and the entire Landsat-derived coral habitat areas showed no significant difference between the two time series (ANCOVA; F-test, p = 0.303, n = 32), despite the different scales of measurements.

Regional-scale seagrass habitat mapping in the Wider Caribbean region using Landsat sensors: Applications to conservation and ecology	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Seagrass meadows occupy a large proportion of the world's coastal oceans and are some of the most productive systems on Earth. Direct and indirect human-derived impacts have led to significant seagrass declines worldwide and the alteration of services linked to their biodiversity. Effective conservation and the provision of sustainable recovery goals for ecologically significant species are limited by the absence of reliable information on seagrass extent. This is especially true for the Wider Caribbean region (WCR) where many conservation initiatives are under way, but are impaired by the lack Of accurate baseline habitat maps. To assist with such a fundamental conservation need using high-resolution remote sensing data, both environmental and methodological challenges need to be tackled. First, the diversity of environments, the heterogeneity of habitats, and the vast extent of the targeted region mean that local expertise and field data of adequate quality and resolution are seldom available. Second, large-scale high-resolution mapping requires several hundred Landsat 5 and 7 images, which poses substantial processing problems. The main goal of this study was to test the feasibility of achieving Landsat-based large-scale seagrass mapping with limited ground-truth data and acceptable accuracies. We used the following combination of methods to map seagrass throughout the WCR: geomorphological segmentation, contextual editing, and supervised classifications. A total of 40 Landsat scenes (path-row) were processed. Three major classes were derived ('dense seagrass', 'medium-sparse seagrass', and a generic 'other' class). Products' accuracies were assessed against (i) selected in situ data; (ii) patterns detectable with very high-resolution IKONOS images; and (iii) published habitat maps with documented accuracies. Despite variable overall classification accuracies (46-88%), following their critical evaluation, the resulting thematic maps were deemed acceptable to (i) regionally Provide an adequate baseline for further large-scale conservation programs and research actions; and (ii) regionally re-assess carrying capacity estimates for green turtles. They certainly represent a drastic improvement relative to current regional databases. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Coastal residents who use mangroves and their resources may have considerable botanical and ecological knowledgeable about these forests. A wide variety of forest products are harvested in mangroves, especially wood for fuel and construction, tannins and medicines. Although there are exceptions, mangrove forest products are typically harvested in a small-scale and selective manner, with harvesting efforts and impacts concentrated in stands that are closer to settlements and easiest to access (by land or by sea). Mangroves support diverse, local fisheries, and also provide critical nursery habitat and marine productivity which support wider commercial fisheries. These forests also provide valuable ecosystem services that benefit coastal communities, including coastal land stabilization and storm protection. The overlapping of marine and terrestrial resources in mangroves creates tenure ambiguities that complicate management and may induce conflict between competing interests. Mangroves have been cut and cleared extensively to make way for brackish water aquaculture and infrastructure development. More attention is now given to managing remaining forests sustainably and to restoring those degraded from past use. Recent advances in remotely sensed, geo-spatial monitoring provide opportunities for researchers and planners to better understand and improve the management of these unique forested wetlands.

Enhanced seamount location database for the western and central Pacific Ocean: Screening and cross-checking of 20 existing datasets	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												Seamounts are habitats of considerable interest in terms of conservation and biodiversity, and in terms of fisheries for bentho-pelagic and pelagic species. Twenty previously compiled datasets including seamount/underwater feature lists, bathymetric maps and emerged feature maps from different sources (ship-derived and satellite altimetry-derived) at different spatial scales (from individual cruise to worldwide satellite data) were gathered in order to compile an enhanced list of underwater features for parts of the western and central Pacific Ocean (WCPO). The KL04 dataset [Kitchingman, A., and Lai, S., 2004. Inferences on potential seamount locations from mid-resolution bathymetric data. Fisheries Centre Research Reports 12 (5), 7-12], listing seamount positions and depths as calculated from satellite altimetry-derived bathymetry, provided the baseline data for this study as it covered the entire region of interest and included summit depth information. All KL04 potential seamounts were cross-checked with other datasets to remove any atolls and islands that had been incorrectly classified as seamounts, to add seamounts undetected by KL04, to update the overall database (geolocation, depth, elevation, and name) and to compile a 12-class typology of the different types of underwater features. of the 4626 potential seamounts identified in KL04, 719 were multiple identifications of the same large underwater features and 373 (10%) were actually emerged banks, atolls and islands, leaving 3534 actual underwater features. Conversely, 487 underwater features were documented in other datasets but not registered by KL04. The screening of all the potential WCPO seamounts produced a final list of 4021 underwater features with agreed upon position and information. This enhanced list should have many applications in oceanography, biodiversity conservation and studies of the influence of seamounts on pelagic ecosystems and fisheries. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Lajeunesse, P				Lajeunesse, Patrick			Early Holocene deglaciation of the eastern coast of Hudson Bay	GEOMORPHOLOGY												The final stage of deglaciation of Hudson Bay was a major Holocene catastrophic event marked by the drainage of Lake Agassiz/Ojibway at similar to 8.47 ka cal BP and the rapid collapse of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. Previous work undertaken in the Nastapoka River area (eastern Hudson Bay) demonstrated that during the relative sea level highstand that shortly followed the drainage of the lake, the western margin of the Quebec-Labrador ice sector rapidly retreated eastward to reach a stillstand position in a coastal hill range. In this study, an analysis of Landsat 7TM images has allowed a mapping of large-scale glacial landforms (outwash deposits, eskers, flutings, and De Geer and Rogen moraines) between Kuujjuaraapik (SE Hudson Bay) and Puvirnituq (NE Hudson Bay). The key results from this mapping are: i) ice-contact outwash deposits mapped along the entire arc-shaped coastline of the eastern Hudson Bay outline a major ice stillstand phase in the coastal bills that extended at least from Kuujjuaraapik to Inukjuak. The presence of these bills allowed a stabilisation of the ice margin that led to the accumulation of thick and extensive ice-contact submarine fans. ii) The position of these deposits on the down ice side (west) of large sets of flutings indicates an important phase of sediment delivery by a rapid ice flow phase toward a marine-based ice margin. iii) A second system of outwash deposits observed farther inland indicates a subsequent phase of stabilisation of the ice margin during its retreat toward central Quebec-Labrador.

Sediments from five cores located in the central part of the Thessaloniki Plain have been studied for their environmental changes using paleontological and sedimentological methods. Chronostratigraphical evidence was obtained from C-14 AMS dating of marine shells, peat and organic sediment samples. During the Holocene marine transgression, this large coastal plain was a shallow marine bay reaching approx. 35 km inland circa the 4th millennium BC, from which the sea subsequently regressed to the east. Around the middle of the 3rd millennium BC, strong fluvial deposition of Aliakmon, to the east, and of Axios, to the north, occurred and was responsible of a gradual change to lagoonal and limnic environmental conditions. Around the 5th Century BC, a freshwater lake occupied the westernmost part of the plain. Microfaunal identification, together with magnetic susceptibility measurements, and grain-size analysis reveal three main environments of sediment deposition that reflect combinations of both concentrated and dispersed sources of magnetic/source minerals. Using remote sensing and a combination of spectral bands (LANDSAT TM imagery), we identify former fluvial levees and a freshwater lake, and give a spatial interpretation of the rivers' influences in building this deltaic complex. The mechanisms of edification of the plain as well as the roles played by Aliakmon and Axios sedimentation are described. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The Jilantai Salt Lake shorelines in northwestern arid China revealed by remote sensing images	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												The existence of a mega-paleolake centered on Jilantai Salt Lake, Inner Mongolia, China, has long been suspected. In the present study, shorelines around Jilantai were identified from astronaut photographs, analyses of Landsat-7 ETM + images, field surveys and differential global positioning system (DGPS) surveys. Here we characterize 1070-1080, 1060, 1050, 1044 and 1035m (a.s.l.) shorelines around Jilantai, which probably correspond to rapid climatic oscillations and tectonic movement and call for further study. Field surveys around Jilantai and in the Hetao Plain located widespread lacustrine deposits and shorelines that provide evidence for a mega-paleolake covering much of the Jilantai and Hetao basins. Based on preliminary Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dating, we speculate that a series of paleolakes probably occupied this region from Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS3) to the Holocene. More detailed investigation is needed for understanding the lake evolution, as well as the environmental impact of Quaternary climatic changes in this region. (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Haze reduction from the visible bands of LANDSAT TM and ETM+ images over a shallow water reef environment	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												A method for haze reduction in the visible bands of Landsat TM and ETM+ images over a shallow water marine environment is presented in this paper. This method uses the near infrared (NIR) band to estimate the spatial distribution of haze intensity in each visible band through a linear regression model established over deep water areas. As a first order approximation, the signal received at the sensor is assumed to be the arithmetic sum of radiance contributed by haze and the radiance leaving the water surface. Reduction of haze is then carried out by a simple subtraction procedure. Images acquired over the Southern Tip of Palawan, Philippines are used for the experiments. Results show that the method works well for compensating signals contaminated by optically thin haze. Overcorrection occurs when haze is optically thick and geometrically complex. When images are acquired under hazy conditions the method can be applied to drastically improve image interpretability and may also be considered as a necessary pre-processing step for subsequent analyses and information extraction.

J	Glasser, NF; Jansson, KN; Harrison, S; Kleman, J				Glasser, Nell F.; Jansson, Krister N.; Harrison, Stephan; Kleman, Johan			The glacial geomorphology and Pleistocene history of South America between 38 degrees S and 56 degrees S	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												This paper presents new mapping of the glacial geomorphology of southern South America between latitudes 38 degrees S and 56 degrees S, approximately the area covered by the former Patagonian Ice Sheets. Glacial geomorphological features, including glacial lineations, moraines, meltwater channels, trimlines, sandur and cirques, were mapped from remotely sensed images (Landsat 7 ETM +, pan-sharpened Landsat 7 and ASTER). The landform record indicates that the Patagonian Ice Sheets consisted of 66 main outlet glaciers, together with numerous local cirque glaciers and independent ice domes in the surrounding mountains. In the northern part of the mapped area, in the Chilean Lake District (38-42 degrees S), large piedmont glaciers developed on the western side of the Andes and the maximum positions of these outlet glaciers are, in general, marked by arcuate terminal moraines. To the east of the Andes between 38 degrees S and 42 degrees S, outlet glaciers were more restricted in extent and formed "alpine-style" valley glaciers. Along the eastern flank of the Andes south of similar to 45 degrees S a series of large fast-flowing outlet glaciers drained the ice sheet. The location of these outlet glaciers was topographically controlled and there was limited scope for interactions between individual lobes. West of the Andes at this latitude, there is geomorphological evidence for an independent ice cap close to sea level on the Taitao Peninsula. The age of this ice cap is unclear but it may represent evidence of glacier growth during the Antarctic Cold Reversal and/or Younger Dryas Chronozone. Maximum glacier positions are difficult to determine along much of the western side of the Andes south of 42 degrees S because of the limited land there, and it is assumed that most of these glaciers had marine termini. In the south-east of the mapped area, in the Fuegan Andes (Cordillera Darwin), the landform record provides evidence of ice-sheet initiation. By adding published dates for glacier advances from the literature we present maps of pre-Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) glacier extent, LGM extent and the positions of other large mapped moraines younger than LGM in age. A number of large moraines occur within the known LGM limits. The age of these moraines is unknown but, since many of them lie well outside the established maximum Neoglacial positions, the possibility that they reflect a return to glacial climates during the Younger Dryas Chronozone or Antarctic Cold Reversal cannot be discounted.

It mainly affects the coastal zone adjacent to areas of dense population. To detect the sources of pollution along this zone as well as to identify their characteristics, remote sensing data was used. Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and Landsat 7 ETM+ satellite images, which have high spatial resolution, were analyzed using different types of software for discriminating polluted water in the marine environment. Different optical and digital advantages in these programs were applied to reveal anomalous features on satellite images. Subsequently, the identified features of pollution were verified in the field with bacterial analysis conducted at selected sites. Results showed 82 major, permanent sources of pollution (termed hotspots) along the Lebanese coast. More than 73% of these sources are attributed to discharges from wastewater, chemicals, and oil residues.																	1527-5922						2008	9	2-3					205	214		10.1080/15275920802122296								WOS:000257013900012

Here, we demonstrate that at high sea level, southeast Australian deep-water sands are delivered by a wave-driven coastal transport system, interacting with estuarine ebb tidal flows, that transports sand over the shelf edge at a change in margin orientation. Discovery of this new process results from an investigation that combines multibeam acoustic, microfaunal, zircon and luminescence dating, oceanographic, Landsat, remotely operated vehicle, and sediment property methods. Our longshore transport-driven model is capable of forecasting new locations for deep-water sand deposits in a predictive paleoclimatic and paleotectonic setting.																	0091-7613					JAN	2008	36	1					15	18		10.1130/G24211A.1								WOS:000252118400004

Fishers from Roviana Lagoon, Solomon Islands, visually interpreted a Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) multi-spectral satellite image to identify shallow-water marine environments. Their assessments were used to direct a supervised classification of the image and create habitat maps with indigenously defined habitat classes. Results show that these participatory remote sensing techniques produce,accurate broad-scale marine habitat maps that can be useful to managers and decision makers. Participatory methods that draw from indigenous habitat definitions also have the potential benefit of generating new insights about socio-ecological processes and enhancing local acceptance and understanding of conservation projects by allowing stakeholders to actively contribute in management planning.

Monitoring fluvial pollen transport, its relationship to catchment vegetation and implications for palaeoenvironmental studies	REVIEW OF PALAEOBOTANY AND PALYNOLOGY												Despite being the most important source of pollen and spore input into most lakes and near-shore marine sediments, we know very little about fluvial (waterborne) pollen and spore transport. This paper presents the results of a dedicated monitoring programme conducted over 2 years and at a catchment scale in South West England. The land use of the nine sub-catchments monitored was determined using Landsat Thematic Data. At two stations, pollen and spore sampling through storm hydrographs was undertaken whilst at the other 7 sub-catchments only peak flow samples were collected. Samples were also collected from re-suspended bed material, riverbanks and at low flows. Airborne pollen flux was monitored using modified Tauber traps. The results support previous research illustrating how the vast majority of fluvial pollen and spores are transported during floods (in this case 9 1 %) and that the main control on waterbome pollen and spore assemblages is the catchment vegetation. However, strong seasonal effects are shown as well as the importance of distinctive sources, such as the riparian input, bed re-suspension and overland flow into drains and tributaries. Fine sediment in river pools appears to act as a selective store of damaged cereal-type pollen grains in arable catchments and this can reduce the inherent underestimate of arable land from pollen diagrams with a high fluvial input and increase the visibility of early agriculture. in order to simulate the likely result of a flood-dominated influx to a small lake scenario, modelling was undertaken whereby different sub-catchments were substituted in order to represent changes in catchment vegetation under a constant hydrological regime. The results show the dampened response of land use groups to catchment land use change, and the frequent occurrence of anomalous single-level peaks due to seasonal flushes from specific near-stream vegetation types. Both these features are commonly seen in lake pollen diagrams. Fluvial pollen and spore loading is dependant upon discharge and so concentrations in laminated or varved sediments could be regarded as a proxy for flood magnitude. The implications for this study on the interpretation of lake and near-shore marine pollen and spore diagrams are discussed and it is argued that a more quantitative approach to waterbome pollen could improve the estimation of land use from lakes in the temperate zone.

We refute this hypothesis by showing that (1) due to its limited area, the Laguna Salada could have evaporated less than 10% of the flood flows that have occurred since 1989; (2) low flow volumes preferentially flow to the Gulf rather than Laguna Salada; (3) All's method for detecting water surface area in the Laguna Salada appears to be flawed because Landsat Thematic Mapper images of the lakebed show it to be dry when All's analyses said it was flooded; (4) direct measurements of salinity at the mouth of the river and in the Upper Gulf of California during flood flows in 1993 and 1998 confirm that flood waters reach the sea; and (5) stable oxygen isotope signatures in clam shells and fish otoliths recorded the dilution of seawater with fresh water during the 1993 and 1998 flows. Furthermore, All's conclusion that freshwater flows do not benefit the ecology of the marine zone is incorrect because the peer-reviewed literature shows that postlarval larval shrimp populations increase during floods, and the subsequent year's shrimp harvest increases. Furthermore, freshwater flows increase the nursery area for Gulf corvina (Cynoscion othonopterus), an important commercial fish that requires estuarine habitats with salinities in the range of 26-38 parts per thousand during its natal stages. Although flood flows are now much diminished compared to the pre-dam era, they are still important to the remnant wetland and riparian habitats of the Colorado River delta and to organisms in the intertidal and marine zone. Only a small fraction of the flood flows are evaporated in Laguna Salada.																	0364-152X	1432-1009				JUL	2007	40	1					1	6		10.1007/s00267-006-0070-8								WOS:000247338100001	17546520

Quantitative remote sensing study indicates doubling of coastal erosion rate in past 50 yr along a segment of the Arctic coast of Alaska	GEOLOGY												A new quantitative coastal land gained-and-lost method uses image analysis of topographic maps and Landsat thematic mapper short-wave infrared data to document accelerated coastal land loss and thermokarst lake expansion and drainage. The data span 1955-2005 along the Beaufort Sea coast north of Teshekpuk Lake in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. Some areas have undergone as much as 0.9 kin of coastal erosion in the past 50 yr. Land loss attributed to coastal erosion more than doubled, from 0.48 km(2) yr(-1) during 1955-1985 to 1.08 km(2) yr(-1) during 1985-2005. Coastal erosion has breached thermokarst lakes, causing initial draining of the lakes followed by marine flooding. Although inland thermokarst lakes show some uniform expansion, lakes breached by coastal erosion display lake expansion several orders of magnitude greater than inland lakes.																	0091-7613					JUL	2007	35	7					583	586		10.1130/G23672A.1								WOS:000247895900002

A new algorithm for estimating chlorophyll-a concentration from multi-spectral satellite data in case II waters: a simulation based on a controlled laboratory experiment	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												This paper presents the spectral decomposition algorithm (SDA), a new algorithm for estimating chlorophyll-a concentration in case II waters using multi-spectral satellite data, which is based on a simulation in a controlled laboratory experiment. The SDA is composed of two key steps. The first of these is to consider the mixed reflectance spectrum of a given pixel as a linear combination of three basic components: clear water, non phytoplankton suspended sediments (NPSS), and phytoplankton. The second step is to use a decomposition coefficient (C-p) obtained from the first step as an independent variable in the chlorophyll-a estimation model, instead of the single band reflectance, band ratio or arithmetic calculation of bands used in conventional methods. The simulated results for the Landsat TM data showed that bands 1, 3 and 4 are useful wavelengths for estimating chlorophyll-a concentrations. In the case of a water body with chlorophyll-a concentrations ranging from 0 to 105 mu g l(-1) and NPSS concentrations ranging from 0 to 100 mg l(-1), the RMSE of the estimation model of chlorophyll-a concentrations based on the SDA was 13.7 mu g l(-1), reduced by nearly half of that for conventional methods (the RMSE was 25.6 mu g l(-1) for the band ratio, and 25.5 mu g l(-1) for the arithmetic calculation of bands). The results of a two-factor ANOVA (without replication) highlight that the decomposition coefficient C-p contains information from phytoplankton far more than from NPSS. However, C-p values were still changed with the addition of NPSS, due mainly to the influence of the interaction of optical properties among phytoplankton, NPSS and water, which occurred in both horizontal and vertical directions in the water bodies. Considering the basic components as a nonlinear combination in a water area may reduce the effect of NPSS on C-p values from that of their linear combination. In addition, the influence of coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM), which is generally considered as one of the optically active substances in case II waters, was ignored according to the practical conditions of our study area, Lake Kasumigaura, Japan in this paper. Users can set the basic components (or endmembers) freely according to the conditions of their own study area when the SDA is used (e.g. considering the CDOM as a basic component in the SDA).

Utilization of multi-dates LANDSAT_TM data to detect and quantify the environmental damages in the southeastern region of Kuwait from 1990 to 1991	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The invasion of Kuwait by Iraqi forces in August 1990, has affected the environment of the Gulf region and of Kuwait in particular. The environmental consequences of military operations and burning of oil wells in 1991 severely affected the air and the marine environment in addition to the terrestrial ecosystems in Kuwait. The air environment received hundreds of thousands of tons of oil soot, carbon oxides and sulphur oxides per day during the crises. The marine and coastal ecosystems were seriously affected by the gushed and drainage of oil onto the Gulf water. The terrestrial ecosystems of Kuwait were severely affected by the drainage of oil that formed networks of oil rivers and lakes. It was also affected by oil soot as well as troops operations. The penetration and solidification of oil with surface sediments led to the formation of new surface layer known as 'Tarcrete'. This paper aims at utilizing multi-dates LANDSAT-TM data to detect and quantify the environmental damages that happened in the terrestrial environment of the southeastern region of Kuwait owing to the Iraqi invasion between 1990 and 1991. The LANDSAT-TM images (165/40) acquired in 1990 and 1991 were selected to carry out this study. The two images were geometrically corrected and enhanced before extracting the subset for the study area, using ERDAS Imagine S/W. The principal components of two dates were also produced and interpreted. Then, the multi-dates enhancement technique of change detection was applied on the resultant principal component images (PC) of the two subsets of December 1990 and November 1991. Finally, the detected environmental damages from the previous step were quantified using the supervised classification technique. The total terrestrial environment of the study area is calculated to be 5240 km(2) The environmental changes are calculated to be 67.7%. The severe and high environmental damages represent 18.7%. These damages represent the new layer of 'Tarcrete' and oil rivers and lakes in the form of a black plume, starting from Magwa, Burgan and Ahmadi oil fields and extending in the southeast direction, parallel to the shoreline until the border between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. The moderate environmental changes, in the form of heavy oil soot, represent 18.8%, whereas the minor changes, in the form of low density of oil soot, represent 30.2% of the study area. Thus, the Kuwaiti environment has suffered from severe environmental damages as a result of the second Gulf war disaster.																	0143-1161					APR	2007	28	7-8					1773	1788		10.1080/01431160600784275								WOS:000246208000021

Rapid mapping and prioritisation of wetland sites in the Manawatu-Wanganui Region, New Zealand	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The extent of wetland in New Zealand has decreased by approximately 90% since European settlement began in 1840. Remaining wetlands continue to be threatened by drainage, weeds, and pest invasion. This article presents a rapid method for broad-scale mapping and prioritising palustrine and estuarine wetlands for conservation. Classes of wetland (lacustrine, estuarine, riverine, marine, and palustrine) were mapped using Landsat ETM+ imagery and centre-points of palustrine and estuarine sites as ancillary data. The results shown are for the Manawatu-Wanganui region, which was found to have 3060 ha of palustrine and 250 ha of estuarine wetlands. To set conservation priorities, landscape indicators were computed from a land-cover map and a digital terrain model. Four global indicators were used (representativeness, area, surrounding naturalness, and connectivity), and each was assigned a value to score wetland sites in the region. The final score is an additive function that weights the relative importance of each indicator (i.e., multicriteria decision analysis). The whole process of mapping and ranking wetlands in the Manawatu-Wanganui region took only 6 weeks. The rapid methodology means that consistent wetland inventories and ranking can now actually be produced at reasonable cost, and conservation resources may therefore be better targeted. With complete inventories and priority lists of wetlands, managers will be able to plan for conservation without having to wait for the collection of detailed biologic information, which may now also be prioritised.

Low-cost bathymetric mapping for tropical marine conservation - A focus on reef fish spawning aggregation sites	MARINE GEODESY												Marine conservation scientists and managers working in the tropics need bathymetric data, yet there exists no relatively simple and inexpensive system to derive them. We designed a system to produce bathymetric maps in 0-1,000 m water depth in less time, with less cost, and with less effort than any other system available. The system uses Landsat TM imagery to guide the collection and visualization of depth soundings obtained with a commercially available fish finder/GPS on a small boat. ArcGIS is used for interpolation and data display. The system was used to map two reef fish spawning aggregation sites in Belize and may be useful for shelf-edge mapping in other tropical locations.																	0149-0419						2007	30	1-2					37	50		10.1080/01490410701295996								WOS:000251571400003

During the 13 years cropland decreased remarkably by nearly 11304.95 ha. The areas of rural-urban construction and water body increased by 10152.24 ha and 848.94 ha, respectively. From 1988 to 2001, 52.5% of the lost cropland was converted into rural-urban industrial land. Rapid urbanization contributed to a great change in the rate of cropland land use during these years. Land-reclamation also contributed to a decrease in water body area as well as marine ecological and environmental destruction. In the study area 1) urbanization and industrialization, 2) infrastructure and agricultural intensification, 3) increased affluence of the farming community, and 4) policy factors have driven the land use changes. Possible sustainable land use measures included construction of a land management system, land planning, development of potential land resources, new technology applications, and marine ecological and environmental protection.																	1002-0160					AUG	2006	16	4					477	488		10.1016/S1002-0160(06)60078-7								WOS:000239446000009

Monitoring turbid freshwater plume characteristics by means of remotely sensed data	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Remotely sensed data may provide easy access for monitoring the spatial separation and obtaining the hydrodynamic characteristics of turbid freshwater plumes created by river flow in the marine environment. Traditional methods are time consuming and require great effort to produce sufficient data. In this project, integrated research has been carried out on a river to demonstrate the utility of remote sensing (RS) technology for studying fundamental theoretical properties of turbulent mixtures. The Filyos River mouth, located on the Black Sea coast of Turkey. is the research area. Flow properties, such as the horizontal dispersion coefficient. have been calculated (using Landsat TM sensor images taken on two different dates). The effects of the plume on the morphology of neighbouring beaches are also examined. This study shows the utility of RS technology for generating quantitative data and better defining the hydraulic behaviour of a river with high turbidity.

J	Stokes, CR; Clark, CD; Winsborrow, MCM				Stokes, CR; Clark, CD; Winsborrow, MCM			Subglacial bedform evidence for a major palaeo-ice stream and its retreat phases in Amundsen Gulf, Canadian Arctic Archipelago	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												Ascertaining the location of palaeo-ice streams is crucial in order to produce accurate reconstructions of palaeo-ice sheets and examine interactions with the ocean-climate system. This paper reports evidence for a major ice stream in Amundsen Gulf, Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Mapping from satellite imagery (Landsat ETM+) and digital elevation models, including bathymetric data, is used to reconstruct flow-patterns on southwestern Victoria Island and the adjacent mainland (Nunavut and Northwest Territories). Several flow-sets indicative of ice streaming are found feeding into the marine trough and cross-cutting relationships between these flow-sets (and utilising previously published radiocarbon dates) reveal several phases of ice stream activity centred in Amundsen Gulf and Dolphin and Union Strait. A large erosional footprint on the continental shelf indicates that the ice stream (ca. 1000 km long and ca. 150 km wide) filled Amundsen Gulf, probably at the Last Glacial Maximum. Subsequent to this, the ice stream reorganised as the margin retreated back along the marine trough, eventually splitting into two separate low-gradient lobes in Prince Albert Sound and Dolphin and Union Strait. The location of this major ice stream holds important implications for ice sheet-ocean interactions and specifically, the development of Arctic Ocean ice shelves and the delivery of icebergs into the western Arctic Ocean during the late Pleistocene.

J	Kutser, T; Metsamaa, L; Strombeck, N; Vahtmae, E				Kutser, T; Metsamaa, L; Strombeck, N; Vahtmae, E			Monitoring cyanobacterial blooms by satellite remote sensing	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Cyanobacterial blooms are attracting the increasing attention of environment agencies, water authorities, and human and animal health organizations, since they can present a range of amenity, water quality ant treatment problems, and hazards to human and animal health. The problem is especially acute in the Baltic Sea where cyanobacterial blooms occur every summer covering areas of more than 100 000 km(2). It has been shown that quantitative mapping of cyanobacteria during bloom conditions is possible with hyperspectral instruments. These sensors, however, cannot provide synoptic spatial coverage and high revisit times needed for near real-time monitoring of potentially harmful blooms. The aim was to estimate whether spectral resolution of multispectral sensors, which can provide needed coverage, is adequate for quantitative mapping of cyanobacteria and whether it is possible to separate potentially harmful blooms of cyanobacteria from waters dominated by algae using ocean colour satellites. The modelling results show that multispectral sensors like ALI, Landsat or MODIS are not capable of separating waters dominated by cyanobacteria from waters dominated by other algae species, as their spectral band configuration does not allow detecting absorption features caused by phycocyanin (present primarily in cyanobacteria) or any other spectral features that are characteristic to cyanobacteria only. MERIS bands 6 and 7 allow detecting phycocyanin absorption feature near 630 nm and a small peak in reflectance spectra near 650 nm characteristic to only cyanobacteria. Thus, MERIS can be used in detecting cyanobacteria if they are present in relatively high quantities. Unfortunately it is not possible to use MERIS for early warning of emerging potentially harmful blooms as the minimum biomass needed to cause features in reflectance spectra typical to cyanobacteria is higher than the biomass already considered as a bloom in the Baltic Sea.

J	Ahn, YH; Shanmugam, P; Ryu, JH; Jeong, JC				Ahn, YH; Shanmugam, P; Ryu, JH; Jeong, JC			Satellite detection of harmful algal bloom occurrences in Korean waters	HARMFUL ALGAE												Cochlodinium polykrikoides (p) is a planktonic dinotlagellate known to produce red tides responsible For massive fish kills and thereby serious economic loss in Korean coastal Waters, particularly during summer and fall seasons. The present study involved analyzing chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) from SeaWiFS ocean color imagery collected over the period 1998-2002 to understand the spatial and temporal aspects of C. polykirikoides blooms that occurred in the enclosed and semi-enclosed bays of the Korean Southeast Sea. NOAA-AVHRR data were Used to derive Sea Surface Temperature (SST) to elucidate physical factors affecting the spatial distribution and abundance Of C polykrikoides blooms. The time series of SeaWiFS-derived Chl-a gave an impression that recent red tide events with higher concentrations appeared to span more than 8 weeks during summer and fall seasons and were widespread in most of the Korean Southeast Sea coastal bays and neighboring oceanic waters. Coupled eutrophication and certain oceanic processes Were thought to give rise to the formation of massive C. polykrikoides blooms with cell abundances ranging from 1000 to 30,000 cells ml(-1), causing heavy mortalities of aquaculture fish and other marine organisms in these areas. Our analysis indicated that Chl-a estimates from SeaWiFS ocean color imagery appeared to be useful in demarcating the locality, spatial extent and distribution of these blooms, but unique identification of C. polykrikoides from non-bloom and sediment dominated waters remains unsuccessful with this data alone. Thus, the classical spectral enhancement and classification techniques such as Forward Principal Component Analysis (FPCA) and Minimum Spectral Distance (MSD) to uniquely identify and better understand C polykrikoides blooms characteristics from other optical water types were attempted on both low spatial resolution SeaWiFS ocean color imagery and high spatial resolution Landsat-7 ETM+ imagery. Application of these techniques could capture intricate and striking patterns of C. polykrikoides blooms from surrounding non-bloom and sediment dominated waters, providing improved capability of detecting, predicting and monitoring C. polykrikoides bloom in such optically complex waters. The result obtained from MSD classification showed that retrieval of C. polykrikoides bloom from the mixed phase of this bloom with turbid waters was not feasible with the SeaWiFS ocean color imagery, but feasible with Landsat-7 ETM+ imagery that provided more accurate and comparable spatial C. polykrikoides patterns consistent with in situ observations. The dense phase of the bloom estimated from these imageries occupied an area of more than 25 kill 2 around the coastal bays and the mixed phase extended over several hundreds kilometers towards the Southeast Sea offshore due to exchange of water masses caused by coastal and oceanic processes. Sea Surface temperature analyzed from AVHRR infrared data captured the northeastward flow of Tsushima Warm Current (TWC) waters that provided favorable environmental conditions for the rapid growth and subsequent southward initiation of C polykrikoides blooms in hydrodynamically active regions in the Korean Southeast Sea offshore.

Wide area observation of the impact of the operation of Younggwang nuclear power plant 5 and 6, No. BSPI 319-00-1426-3, KORDI, Seoul, Korea]. Here the spatial and temporal characteristics of the thermal plume signature of warm water are reported from a time series (1985-2003) of space-borne, thermal infrared data from Landsat and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellites. Sea surface temperature (SST) were characterized using advanced very high resolution radiometer data from the NOAA satellites. These data demonstrated the general pattern and extension of the thermal plume signature in the Younggwang coastal areas. In contrast, the analysis of SST from thematic mapper data using the Landsat-5 and 7 satellites provided enhanced information about the plume shape, dimension and direction of dispersion in these waters. The thermal plume signature was detected from 70 to 100 km to the south of the discharge during the summer monsoon and 50 to 70 km to the northwest during the winter monsoon. The mean detected plume temperature was 28 degrees C in summer and 12 degrees C in winter. The AT varied from 2 to 4 degrees C in winter and 2 degrees C in summer. These values are lower than the re-circulating water temperature (6-9 degrees C). In addition the temperature difference between tidal flats and offshore (SSTtidal flats - SSToffsore) was found to vary from 5.4 to 8.5 degrees C during the flood tides and 3.5 degrees C during the ebb tide. The data also suggest that water heated by direct solar radiation on the tidal flats during the flood tides might have been transported offshore during the ebb tide. Based on these results we suggest that there is an urgent need to protect the health of Younggwang coastal marine ecosystem from the severe thermal impact by the large quantity of warm water discharged from the Younggwang nuclear power plant.

J	Pena, SA; Abdelsalam, MG				Pena, SA; Abdelsalam, MG			Orbital remote sensing for geological mapping in southern Tunisia: Implication for oil and gas exploration	JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES					20th Colloquium on African Geology	JUN, 2004	Orleans, FRANCE					Southern Tunisia is dominated by early to middle Triassic continental sandstones inter-bedded with shales and conglomerates followed by late Triassic shallow marine carbonates, lower Jurassic evaporates, and upper Jurassic to lower Cretaceous elastic sedimentary rocks. These constitute the Dahar Plateau (which is part of the Ghadames Basin and it is the focus of this study) that was developed in association with regional uplift of the Saharan Platform. Efforts in mapping the details of surface geology in southern Tunisia are hindered by the lack of continuous bedrock outcrops, where some of the formations are buried under the sand of the Sahara Desert. Remote sensing data including multi-spectral optical (Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) and the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER)), radar (RADARSAT), and Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) extracted from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data are used to trace along strike continuity of different lithological units as well as mapping morphologically defined structures in southern Tunisia. Landsat ETM+ and ASTER Red-Green-Blue (RGB) color combination images (both band and band-ratio images) have been used for the identification of various lithological units when they are exposed on the surface. On the other hand, RADARSAT images have been utilized for tracing geological formations and geological structures that are buried under thin (similar to 1 m) sand. Fusion of optical and radar remote sensing data using Color Normalization Transformation (CNT) has been effectively implemented to further identify lithological units and geological structures. Hill-shading techniques are applied to SRTM DEMs to enhance terrain perspective views and to extract geomorphological features and morphologically defined structures through the means of lineament analysis. Results from remote sensing analysis are in good agreement with results obtained from in situ investigations including geological mapping and seismic exploration. Identifying lithological and structural features using remote sensing studies incorporated with surface and sub-surface geological investigations in southern Tunisia can aid exploration for new oil and gas fields. Such an approach of integrating remote sensing and in situ geological studies can be successfully adopted in other parts of North Africa and arid regions in general. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The supralittoral and the mediolittoral were mapped as a function of the coastal lithology and the presumed levels of human impact (both in scale of 1:100,000). The infralittoral was mapped on the basis of spatial modelling (using neural networks as a modelling tool, data about habitats collected by fieldwork as the independent variable for training and testing the model, and the digital bathymetrical model, the distance from coast, the second spectral channel of Landsat ETM+ satellite image and the sea bottom sea temperature, salinity and current magnitude, as dependent variables). The circalittoral and the bathyal were mapped by overlapping and reinterpretation of the existing spatial databases (bathymetry and lithology) within the framework of the raster-GIS.

L. majuscula is a toxic cyanobacteria which fixes nitrogen and is found attached to: seagrass, algae and coral. The toxic and smothering nature of L. majuscula has affected human and environmental health in sensitive coastal ecosystems. To reduce these impacts, monitoring is an essential component of studying the origins and development of L. majuscula blooms. An accurate and cost effective means to map the extent of a bloom and its biophysical properties is needed. This study presents an operational approach for mapping the extent of L. majuscula blooms in the clear and shallow water regions of Moreton Bay, eastern Australia, from a combination of field and remotely sensed data sets. The ability to discriminate L. majuscula from other substrate types over a range of depths was first examined using detailed field reflectance spectra, measured optical properties of Moreton Bay waters and a radiative transfer model (Hydrolight 4.1). A two-stage process was then used to map L. majuscula. The spatial extent of L. majuscula and other major substrate types was first recorded from a boat-based survey by marine park authorities using point-based GPS measurements. This sampling was timed to coincide with an overpass of the Landsat 7 ETM+ sensor. When the results of the boat-based mapping detected more than 25% L. majuscula cover in the study area, a cloud free Landsat 7 ETM+ image was acquired for that date. In the second stage of mapping, selected field survey data provided the basis for a supervised classification of the ETM+ image data to map L. majuscula. Effort and accuracy assessment of both field and image mapping methods indicated a trade-off between areal coverage and mapping accuracy. The Landsat 7 ETM+ based mapping procedure provided 100% areal coverage with 58% accuracy. In contrast, the boat-based field survey method covered only 0.5% of the study area, but with almost 100% mapping accuracy. The approach outlined in this work has been adopted as a standard operating procedure in Moreton Bay. This study illustrates how remote sensing can be combined with field monitoring, to provide marine park authorities with useful information to understand and manage blooms. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Satellite remote sensing offers great potential for this scope, although the interpretation of the spectral responses of shallow areas is complicated by the mixed signal coming from the water column and the bottom. This is particularly the case when using satellite data taken in few wide spectral channels, such as those of the Landsat TM and ETM+ sensors, which were not specifically designed for marine applications. Relying on the hypothesis that these data are anyway informative on shallow water conditions, an unsupervised procedure was developed to separate the spectral contributions of seawater and bottom on the basis of simple approximations. The procedure is based on the simulation of different water/bottom multispectral configurations up to find out that which best fits the observed data. The validation of the procedure was carried out by its application first to synthetic images and next to two TM and one ETM+ scenes taken over the Orbetello Lagoon in Central Italy. The outputs produced in the latter case were evaluated by comparison to existing ground references. In particular, correlation analyses were performed between the original and decomposed spectral signatures and the concentrations of optically active water constituents (pigments and yellow substance) measured "in situ" at dates close to those of the satellite data acquisitions. These analyses demonstrated the potential of the methodology, while also highlighting some limitations which could be overcome through the use of imagery taken by sensors with enhanced spectral and radiometric features.

This unique resource is virtually intact, until recently being impacted only by local consumption. Increasing exports to Tahiti's market (up to 50 tonnes of wet matter y(-1)), combined with the relatively small size of these lagoons (< 50 km(2)), have raised significant concerns for agencies charged with management of lagoonal resources. In order to evaluate whether the current harvesting pressure threatens long-term sustainability of this resource, it is necessary to estimate the total number of individual clams present and also the fraction of that stock that is currently targeted by fishers, who generally collect clams in very shallow waters (< 1 m), walking on the reef edges. Here, we present results for a pilot study evaluating this resource at Fangatau Atoll. Using a combination of data collected in situ and three remotely sensed images with different spatial resolution (1.5, 5.6, and 30 m), we estimate that the shallowest lagoonal areas (4.05 km(2) at depth < 6 m) harbour five classes of benthic habitat with significantly different clam areal covers and densities. Considering the cover/density values for each habitat class, 23.65 +/- 5.33 million clams (mean +/- 95% confidence interval) inhabit these 4.05 km(2). Assuming that current harvesting techniques will be maintained in the future, the commercially available stock represents 44% of the population located on 1.18 km(2) of the shallow lagoon. A comparison of results from the three remote sensing platforms indicates that high resolution, broadband multispectral sensors (e.g. IKONOS, Quickbird) should provide the best existing platforms to conduct similar assessments elsewhere.

They extend for tens of kilometres, forming fracture intensification zones several hundred metres wide. WNW- to NW-oriented faults run parallel to the mountain fronts in the plains adjoining the central Hajar range then obliquely crosscut the mountains in the north. Motion along these faults explains how Quaternary marine terraces became elevated 190m above sea level. A second fault set strikes north to NNE. The associated juvenile topography suggests that they also accommodate recent uplift, subsidiary to the WNW-striking faults, with minor strike-slip and differential movement between various segments of the Hajar Mountains. Both fault systems, and the amount of Quaternary uplift (between 100 and 500 m), are similar to those in other active and ancient forebulge environments. Using the fracture patterns observed, it is proposed here that the Hajar range lies on the active forebulge of a collision zone between the NE margins of the Arabian plate, the Zagros fold belt and the Makran accretionary prism, which resulted in the recent uplift.

Continuous land/sea terrain was mapped by merging Digital Elevation Models (DEM) with satellite-derived bathymetry. Benthic habitat characterizations were created by-unsupervised classifications of Landsat imagery clustered using field data, and produced maps with an estimated overall accuracy of > 75% (Tau coefficient > 0.65). These were merged with Geocover-LC (land use/land cover) data to create continuous land/sea cover maps. Image pairs from different dates were analyzed using Principle Components Analysis (PCA) in order to detect areas of change in the marine environment over two different time intervals: 2000 to 2001, and 1991 to 2003. This activity demonstrates the capabilities of Landsat imagery to produce continuous summit-to-sea maps, as well as detect certain changes in the shallow-water marine environment, providing a valuable tool for efficient coastal zone monitoring and effective management and conservation.																	0034-7744					MAY	2005	53			1			185	193										WOS:000230498900021	17465158

The three largest synrift Gulf of Suez fields (Belayim Land, Belayim Marine, and Morgan) are located along major fault-transfer zones that optimized the conditions for the deposition and preservation of thick point-sourced sands adjacent to extensive hydrocarbon source kitchens. Belayirn Land and Morgan fields contain stacked submarine fan, delta, and alluvial fan systems that developed during the deposition of the Miocene Rudeis, Kareem, and Belayim-South Gharib formations, respectively. This continuous, point-sourced sedimentation is indicative of stable drainage and by inference, a stable eastern border fault system. We attribute this stable border fault system to a stress heterogeneity related to the pre-existing Najd Shear Zone, and polarity reversals in upper-plate transport direction. Tectonic restorations indicate that the North Red Sea, like the Gulf of Suez, should have reservoir facies deposited in similar structural positions, but preservation is a significant risk due to additional crustal extension. Although crestal block erosion remains a great concern for reservoir preservation, seismic mapping indicates that block size along the coastal region and inboard areas are similar to the Gulf of Suez. This suggests that most of the strain may have been accommodated along the warmer axial portion of the rift where weaker crustal rheology exists. Landsat mapping of the Northeast Red Sea border fault system has found a high degree of variability in structural styles. The southern Yanbu-Jeddah and Umm. Luj-Al Wajh sub-basins are bound by listric, down-to the west-southwest border faults, separated by suture-controlled accommodation zones. To the north, the Midyan-Ifal sub-basin is located along the Miocene flexural margin, and is structurally more complex. Northwesterly-trending (Najd Shear Zone) planar faults are overprinted by a strong northeasterly (Aqaba) trend, such that transpressional and transtensional features exist. Although structurally complex, the offshore northern flexural margin has been determined to have the best potential for localized, second-generation, thick, synrift sediments similar to that of the Gulf of Suez.																	1025-6059						2005	10	1					97	124										WOS:000231694000004

This region has a diversity of metasedimentary rocks, granitic intrusives, felsic to intermediate volcanic rocks, and continental and marine sedimentary deposits. The TM 742 band combination on a RGB false color composite was the most revealing for lithologic discrimination of the main Neogene volcanic, and Quaternary sedimentary units overlying the metamorphic and granitic basement. An enhanced contrast between lithologic units was produced by the selective principal component analysis using the second components for the TM band pairs 5-7, 4-7 and 2-7 on a RGB false color composite. Through the reassignment and generalization of a supervised classification, we obtained 26 lithologic classes; thirteen Cenozoic volcanic rocks and intrusives, three pre-Cretaceous metamorphic units, and ten Plio-Quaternary sedimentary classes. The latter differ among each other by the source rocks and relative age. The resulting lithologic map of the supervised classification was evaluated using the confusion matrix and Kappa index (kappa). The map obtained a 79% confidence level, and kappa = 0.733, indicating that this map meets the evaluation criteria, and allow to us to recommend this methodology for geologic studies in desert areas.

The GIS was established because there is a paucity of collated information on the marine resources of Rodrigues, western Indian Ocean, hampering marine environmental protection. The GIS was established in MapInfo software using a Landsat satellite image as a base layer. Field surveys were undertaken at 183 sites throughout the lagoon and reefs to ground-truth the satellite image. A hierarchical biotope classification was developed and 42 biotopes were described within four habitat groups (Coral, Sand and rubble with mixed vegetation, Lagoon muds, and Consolidated limestone), and used to create a biotope map layer. A relational database was linked to the GIS to store and display site-based data, including biotope descriptions and photographs, species lists and illustrations, and environmental data. GIS output is exemplified by thematic maps illustrating species richness and habitat at sites, percentage cover of benthic life forms, data collection sites and depths, and number of octopus and potential octopus refugia. The GIS was also used to identify the biotopes protected by proposed Marine Protected Areas, illustrating that some existing MPAs may be ineffective and proposed boundaries could protect more than 30% of the shallow marine environment of Rodrigues. The GIS provides a useful tool to establish the conservation and sustainable use of the island's marine resources, and the highly visual and interactive system should prove valuable for education and public awareness purposes.																	0022-2933					DEC	2004	38	23-24					2937	2957		10.1080/00222930410001695015								WOS:000223942300002

This paper presented two datasets to extract information on hydrocarbon pollution in marine environment utilizing visible to near infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. The datasets used were Landsat ETM+ images for Dubai and Fujirah coasts, and experimental visible to near infrared spectra of petroleum hydrocarbon in water. The experimental spectra were measured using GER 3700 spectroradiometer. The study applied image analyses techniques and radiance ratios on corrected Landsat ETM+ images in order to detect oil spills from tankers. The reported results demonstrated proper bands or channels with techniques useful for oil spill detection using images of Landsat ETM+. The study found that radiances extracted from visible and near infrared images are useful to assess the thickness of hydrocarbon spills. The study also found that areas of thicker oil are slightly brighter because they suppress the signal from the underlying seawater. The spectra of GER 3700 provide potentials for identification of possible contaminants as well as classification within a particular hydrocarbon category (e.g. aromatics). The presented techniques hold promise for rapid analysis of petroleum hydrocarbons in marine environment.																	0749-0208					FAL	2004	20	4					1089	1095		10.2112/03-0023R.1								WOS:000225276900012						
J	Naseer, A; Hatcher, BG				Naseer, A; Hatcher, BG			Inventory of the Maldives' coral reefs using morphometrics generated from Landsat ETM+ imagery	CORAL REEFS												In this study, we present exact measures of the number, area, and basic morphometric statistics for every single reef of the Maldivian archipelago, as derived from the interpretation of remotely sensed data collected by the Landsat-7 ETM+ earth-observing satellite sensor. We classified and mapped seven morphological attributes of reefs (six marine habitats and reef-top islands) to 30-m depth at 30x30 m spatial resolution (pixel size) for the entire archipelago. The total archipelagic area (all coral reef and lagoon habitats) of the 16 atolls, five oceanic faros, and four oceanic platform reefs which comprise the Maldives is 21,372.72+/-1,068.64 km(2) (approx. 20% of the Maldives' Territorial Sea). A total of 2,041+/-10 distinct coral reef structures larger than 0.01 km(2) occur in the Maldives, covering an area of 4,493.85 km(2) (including enclosed reef lagoons and islands) to 30-m depth. Smaller areas of coral reef substratum cover another 19.29 km(2), bringing the total area of Maldivian coral reefs to 4,513.14+/-225.65 km(2). Shallow coral platforms thus occupy 21.1% of the total area of the archipelago (0.0052% of the EEZ area of the Maldives). Of these reefs, 538 are rim and oceanic reefs, covering 3,701.93 km(2) (82.5% of the total reef area), and 1,503 are patch reefs within the atoll lagoons, covering 791.92 km(2) (17.5% of the total reef area). Islands occupy only 5.1% of the total reef area. Mapping the Maldives' coral reefs at high spatial resolution is only possible with remote sensing and spatial analysis technologies. These greatly reduce the large uncertainty around current estimates of reef area. Our accurate measure of total reef area is only 50.6% of the current best estimate, a result having significant implications for predictions of the Maldives' reef productivity and response to global climate change. Here we present current best practice and compare the methods and measures with previous approaches.																	0722-4028					APR	2004	23	1					161	168		10.1007/s00338-003-0366-6								WOS:000220937200016

Results needed to be comprehensive, synoptic, objective, affordable, and on a suitable spatial scale. We chose to address these goals by applying accepted procedures utilizing existing Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery and a computer-generated unsupervised classification. Unsupervised classification of high and low tide Landsat TM images yielded coherent habitat maps that were supported by reference data and independent habitat analyses. The high tide image revealed surface water patterns that supported the existence of a large, Central Bay dipole eddy predicted by a numerical three-dimensional circulation model. Classification of the low tide image resulted in 14 intertidal and water habitat classes being defined. Overall accuracy of the classification was 86%. Good agreement in habitat areas existed between the affordable and easily repeatable satellite survey and four other Cobscook Bay surveys which differed methodologically and temporally. The four studies agreed within 7% of total habitat area and 12% on intertidal habitat area. The area of both brown and green algae in the Bay apparently increased modestly over a 25-year period which saw the introduction of large-scale salmon aquaculture and the advent of intensive dragging for scallops and sea urchins. The increase in both groups is inconsistent with changes induced by nutrient additions observed elsewhere. Landsat imagery appears to be a valuable tool for the management and monitoring of macrotidal environments.																	1092-6194						2004	11				2		225	242		10.1656/1092-6194(2004)11[225:UOCERS]2.0.CO;2								WOS:000231132300013

Spatial change in distribution of eelgrass, Zostera marina L., was assessed at Bahia San Quintin, Baja California, Mexico, using a map to map comparison of data interpreted from a 1987 Satellite Pour I'Observation de la Terre multispectral satellite image and a 2000 Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapping image. Eelgrass comprised 49% and 43% of the areal extent of the bay in 1987 and 2000, respectively. Spatial extent of eelgrass was 13% less (-321 ha) in 2000 than in 1987 with most losses occurring in subtidal areas. Over the 13-yr study period, there was a 34% loss of submerged eelgrass (-457 ha) and a 13% (+136 ha) gain of intertidal eelgrass. Within the two types of intertidal eelgrass, the patchy cover class (< 85% cover) expanded (+250 ha) and continuous cover class ( greater than or equal to 85% cover) declined (-114 ha). Most eelgrass losses were likely the result of sediment loading and turbidity caused by a single flooding event in winter of 1992-1993. Recent large-scale agricultural development of adjacent uplands may have exacerbated the effects of the flood. Oyster farming was not associated with any detectable losses in eelgrass; spatial extent, despite the increase in number of oyster racks from 57 to 484 over the study period.

The highest shoreline is at 386 m elevation and was eroded when the White Nile formed a lake as wide as 70 km and >500 km long. Finely laminated green clays laid down on the floor of this lake are overlain by alluvial sands and clays, dated by optically stimulated luminescence as 15 ka to older than 250 ka. The alluvium was deposited during interglacial episodes of stronger summer monsoons and very high White Nile floods. The White Nile paleolake is much older than marine oxygen isotope stage 7 and may have formed ca. 400 ka, during the exceptionally long stage 11 interglacial.																	0091-7613					NOV	2003	31	11					1001	1004		10.1130/G19801.1								WOS:000186411100019

A Delta 11 rocket successfully launched it on November 21, 2000,from Vandenberg AFB, California. SAC-C has been designed primary to fulfil the requirements of large countries or little populated ones like Argentina. Its design is a good compromise between resolution and swath width that permits SAC-C to be an appropriate tool for global and high dynamic phenomena studies. Large coverage, multispectral and panchromatic capabilities, medium ground resolution and short revisit time are its main characteristics. SAC-C carries instruments to monitoring the condition and dynamics of the terrestrial and marine biosphere and environment; helping to better understand the Earth's magnetic field and related Sun Earth interactions; developing and utilizing new GPS based techniques to globally measure atmospheric phenomena for the study of weather, and new methods of attitude and orbit determination; and performing studies of the influence of space radiation on advanced electronic components. SAC-C is part of the AM Constellation together with Landsat 7, Terra and EO 1.

J	Rozendaal, MA; Rossow, WB				Rozendaal, MA; Rossow, WB			Characterizing some of the influences of the general circulation on subtropical marine boundary layer clouds	JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES												The seasonal and intraseasonal variability of boundary layer cloud in the subtropical eastern oceans is studied using combined data from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts reanalysis. Spectral analysis reveals that most of the time variability of cloud properties occurs on seasonal to annual timescales. The variance decreases by one to two orders of magnitude for each decade of timescale decrease, indicating that daily to monthly timescales and their spatial extent have smaller, although nonnegligible, variability. The length of these dominant timescales suggests that the majority of the variability is influenced by the general circulation and its interaction with boundary layer turbulence, rather than being a product of local boundary layer turbulence alone. Although the dominance of seasonal to annual periods in the temporal power spectra of low-cloud fraction-TAU and CTP-justifies the previous focus of effort on seasonal variability, intraseasonal data can be better used to examine the cloud formation/dissipation processes as revealed in relationships between synoptic meteorology and cloud properties. Previous datasets have lacked the necessary combination of resolution and scope in either time or space coverage to properly characterize variability on synoptic and larger scales; this is remedied by using global satellite-retrieved cloud properties. The intraseasonal subtropical cloud variability in both hemispheres and in different seasons are characterized. In addition to cloud fraction, variability of cloud optical thickness and cloud-top pressure frequency distributions are examined. The intraseasonal variability is divided into three types. The first type, found in the Californian local summer and Southern Hemisphere regions year round, is characterized by lower-altitude, greater optical thickness, stationary clouds. The second type is found in the Canarian local summer and has more instances of smaller cloud-top pressures and a westward propagation direction. The third type, found in Northern Hemisphere regions during winter, is similar to the second type, but shows an eastward propagation direction. This study focuses on the third type more closely and finds it to be associated with the lower sea level pressure, upward vertical velocity phase of synoptic waves.

J	Mumby, PJ; Edwards, AJ				Mumby, PJ; Edwards, AJ			Mapping marine environments with IKONOS imagery: enhanced spatial resolution can deliver greater thematic accuracy	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The IKONOS 2 satellite was launched in late 1999 and carries the first commercial multispectral instrument to achieve 4 in spatial resolution. The cost and accuracy of using IKONOS imagery to map shallow-water marine environments is evaluated and compared directly to that using a suite of satellite and airborne instruments including Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS) and Thematic Mapper (TM), Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) High-Resolution Visible (HRV) multispectral and panchromatic, and Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI). Evaluations were conducted in the Turks and Caicos Islands which are ideally suited to aquatic remote sensing because of the large areas of clear, shallow water containing a range of different habitats. Over 600 field sites were surveyed and used to define habitat categories, supervise image classification, and make an independent assessment of thematic map accuracy. For the high-resolution IKONOS imagery, pixel sizes were small enough to allow within-habitat textural information to be added to the classification. Making full use of this textural information in supervised classifications significantly improved (P<.01) thematic map accuracy for fine-level habitat discrimination (13 classes). Although significantly (P<.001) and almost 20% more accurate than Landsat TM, like other satellite-borne sensors, IKONOS data were unable adequately to discriminate 13 categories of coral, algal, and seagrass habitats (overall accuracy 50%). Comparison with CASI in a restricted area where only nine of these habitats were represented indicated that CASI (81% user accuracy) was significantly (P<.01) more accurate than IKONOS (64% user accuracy). Comparisons of IKONOS, Landsat TM, and CASI along a transect in the maximally penetrating blue part of the spectrum suggest that the poor descriptive resolution of satellite sensors is partly due to loss of radiance contrast, presumably as a result of atmospheric Rayleigh scattering. Problems of scattering, coupled with the relatively poor spectral resolution of satellite sensors such as IKONOS, currently constrain their use for fine-level marine habitat mapping. IKONOS data enabled significantly more accurate mapping at a geomorphological scale (e.g., coral vs. seagrass) than other satellite sensors except Landsat TM. While reasonably high accuracies (75%) were obtained for such coarse-level habitat mapping, Landsat TM was more cost-effective than IKONOS, even for small (50 km(2)) areas. IKONOS may only be a cost-effective option if (i) independent field data are available to identify habitat patches, (ii) the area to be mapped is fairly small (<500 km(2)), and (iii) small-scale (<10 in) habitat dynamics are to be monitored. IKONOS data are unlikely to identify deterioration in coral reefs directly because changes in community structure cannot be resolved spectrally from the satellite. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

The spatial extent of benthic microalgae on Heron Reef (southern Great Barrier Reef, Australia) was mapped using data from the Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper sensor. integrated with field measurements of sediment chlorophyll concentration and reflectance. Field-measured sediment chlorophyll concentrations. 2 ranging from 23-1.153 mg chl a m(2), were classified into low, medium, and high concentration classes (1-170, 171-290, and > 291 mg chl a m(-2)) using a K-means clustering algorithm. The mapping process assumed that areas in the Thematic Mapper image exhibiting similar reflectance levels in red and blue bands would correspond to areas of similar chlorophyll a levels. Regions of homogenous reflectance values corresponding to low, medium, and high chlorophyll levels were identified over the reef sediment zone by applying a standard image classification algorithm to the Thematic Mapper image. The resulting distribution map revealed large-scale ( > 1 km 2) patterns in chlorophyll a levels throughout the sediment zone of Heron Reef. Reef-wide estimates of chlorophyll a distribution indicate that benthic Microalgae may constitute up to 20% of the total benthic chlorophyll a at Heron Reef. and thus contribute significantly to total primary productivity on the reef.

J	Rankey, EC				Rankey, EC			Spatial patterns of sediment accumulation on a Holocene carbonate tidal flat, northwest Andros Island, Bahamas	JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY RESEARCH												To characterize spatial patterns of sedimentation and analyze the morphology of part of the modern tidal flats of northwest Andros Island in the Bahamas, this study integrated remote sensing, geographic information systems (GIS), and carbonate sedimentology. The fundamental data are a Landsat TM image that has been classified to create a thematic map of eight subfacies, interpreted to represent a distinct tidal-flat subenvironment such as adjacent marine, exposed levee-beach ridge, pond, and algal marsh. Spatial statistics of the thematic map characterize the patterns of sediment accumulation. Quantitative analysis highlights several interesting results concerning subfacies character and distribution: (1) of the eight mapped subfacies, low algal marsh is most widespread, representing 27.5% of the total area, whereas exposed levee-beach ridge is the least widespread, accounting for 10% of the area; (2) the patches of different subfacies have different shape complexities, with low algal marsh, high algal marsh, and mangrove ponds being the least complex and exposed levee-beach ridge being the most complex; (3) Markov chain analysis suggests that lateral transitions between different subfacies are highly ordered; and (4) frequency distribution of subfacies patch area and lacunarity (gap size distribution) data exhibit power law relationships over several orders of magnitude, consistent with fractal characteristics. The fractal nature of patch size and gaps between facies illustrate that on this tidal flat neither the size nor the spatial distribution of subfacies has a characteristic scale. This statistical behavior is consistent with the presence of self-organization, or emergence of pattern in the absence of a template or external forcing. The statistical self-organization on the tidal flat is the cumulative expression of local processes, but it becomes apparent only through analysis of the whole system. These results are inconsistent with models suggesting that tidal flats include a migrating complex of randomly distributed, randomly sized subenvironments. Ancient successions that include random patterns may reflect the more pronounced influence of forces external to the sedimentary system, instead of an absence of those forces.

J	Heidinger, AK; Stephens, GL				Heidinger, AK; Stephens, GL			Molecular line absorption in a scattering atmosphere. Part III: Pathlength characteristics and effects of spatially heterogeneous clouds	JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES												The paper analyzes the influence of horizontal variability of clouds on sunlight reflected in a narrow portion of the solar spectrum and how this influence affects the ability to estimate cloud properties from measurements of reflection. This paper is part of a series that examines the use of high-resolution measurements of absorption lines of the oxygen A band located between 0.763 and 0.773 mum as a way of deriving information on cloud structure presently unobtainable from other passive measurements. The effects of spatial heterogeneity on reflectances and pathlength distributions are examined for marine stratocumulus cloud fields derived from Landsat data. The results showed that for the marine stratocumulus fields studied, the radiance errors were on the order of 3%-20%, and the spectral radiance ratio (in-band to out-of-band) errors were on the order of 1%-5%. When these errors are too large, the retrieved quantities possess too much error to be useful. The errors due to horizontal transport of photons and subpixel variability are studied independently as a function of spatial scale. Using both the radiance and radiance ratios, a technique was developed that allows the plane-parallel forward model typically used in retrieval schemes to be able to predict when its retrievals are so influenced by spatial heterogeneity that the results are invalid. This ability would represent a significant step forward in the current abilities of passive retrievals, which cannot determine the effect of cloud spatial variability on their retrievals. Lastly, a method was demonstrated that used domain-averaged measurements of absorption formed by reflection along with plane-parallel theory to estimate the distribution of optical depth throughout the domain. The results for the four simulated cloud fields showed this technique to have significant promise in quickly classifying the level of cloud heterogeneity over a large area.

A 100-MHz airborne radar, digital Landsat imagery, and satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry are used to investigate its form and flow, including the proportion of mass lost through iceberg calving. The ice cap was covered by a 10-km-spaced grid of radar flight paths, and the central portion was covered by a grid at 5-km intervals: a total of 1,657 km of radar data. Digital elevation models (DEMs) of ice surface elevation, ice thickness, and bed elevation data sets were produced (cell size 500 m). The DEMs were used in the selection of a deep ice core drill site. To tal ice cap volume is 2,1 84 km(3) (similar to5.5 mm sea level equivalent). The ice cap has a single dome reaching 749 m. Maxi mum ice thickness is 819 m. About 200 km, or 42%, of the ice margin is marine. About 50% of the ice cap bed is below sea level. The central divide of the ice cap and several major drain age basins, in the south and east of the ice cap and of up to 975 km(2), are delimited from satellite imagery. The re is no evidence of past surge activity on the ice cap. SAR interferometric fringes and phase-unwrapped velocities for the whole ice cap indicate slow flow in the interior and much of the margin, punctuated by four fast flowing features with lateral shear zones and maxi mum velocity of 140 m yr(-1). These ice streams extend back into the slower moving ice to within 5 - 10 km of the ice cap crest. They have lengths of 17 - 37 km and widths of 4 - 8 km. Mass flux from these ice streams is similar to0.54 km(3) yr(-1). Tabular icebergs up to similar to1.7 km long are produced. Total iceberg flux from the ice cap is similar to0.65 km(3) yr(-1) and probably represents similar to40% of the overall mass loss, with the remainder coming from surface melting. Driving stresses are generally low est (< 40 kPa) close to the ice cap divides and in several of the ice streams. Ice stream motion is likely to include a significant basal component and may involve deformable marine sediments.

It is suggested that gypsum primarily precipitates at isolated points of evaporitic concentration, such as inland playas, and that deflation of evaporitic-rich gypsum dust from these playas contributes to the formation of pedogenic gypsum duricrusts on the coastal gravel plains of the Namib Desert surrounding these playas. This study establishes the nature, extent and distribution of playas in the Central Namib Desert and provides evidence for playa gypsum deflation and gravel plain deposition. Remote sensing shows the distribution of playas, captures ongoing deflation and provides evidence of gypsum deflation. It is proposed that, following primary marine aerosol deposition, both inland playas and coastal sabkhas generate gypsum which through the process of playa deflation and gravel plain redeposition contributes to the extensive pedogenic crusts found in the Namib Desert region.

Suspended sediment converges and is deposited rapidly along the shear front zone; this is because a low-velocity zone is formed between two inverse flow bodies. Some small eddies occur in the shear front zone, shown on (method of concentration-temperature ratio) mapping; this is conducive to rapid convergence and accumulation of the suspended sediment in the shear front. At the same time, some hyperpycnal plumes and gravity-driven underflow may be formed; these move away from the shear front zone, due to the high sediment concentrations there. The shear front is formed firstly at the prodelta area; it then moves to the river mouth, in response to the flood or ebb tidal controls and deep sea influences, It moves along the subaqueous delta slope for 1/2-1/3 or me tidal cycle, during the over flood season. The shear front zone of low velocity forms a wall of water that prevents dispersal of the river outflow. The temperature image from TM6 shows that a river-sea interaction zone, a transition between the river and sea water temperatures, occurs around the mouth. The shear front is formed within this zone. A four-stage dynamic process, related to the shear front during the tidal cycle, is discussed, The results show that the shear front occurs twice during a tidal cycle. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Chambers, LH; Wielicki, BA; Loeb, NG				Chambers, LH; Wielicki, BA; Loeb, NG			Shortwave flux from satellite-measured radiance: A theoretical study over marine boundary layer clouds	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY												Earth radiation budget measurements, important to climate monitoring and to validating climate models, require that radiances measured by satellite instruments be converted to hemispherical flux. This paper examines that problem theoretically, using inhomogeneous cloud models constructed from Landsat scenes of marine boundary layer clouds. The spherical harmonics discrete ordinates method (SHDOM) code is applied to the model scenes to compute full two-dimensional radiation fields, which then simulate measured radiances. Inversion to flux is performed by several different methods, including plane-parallel table lookup and empirical angular distribution models with three different ways of determining scene identification, to examine error sources and relative magnitudes. Using a simple plane-parallel table lookup results in unacceptably large flux bias errors of 11%-60%, depending on the orbital viewing geometry. This bias can be substantially reduced, to no more than 6%, by using empirical angular distribution models. Further improvement, to no more than 2% flux bias error, is obtained if known biases in optical-depth retrievals are taken into account when building the angular models. Last, the bias can be further reduced to a fraction of a percent using scene identification based on multiple views of the same area. There are limits, however, to the reduction in the instantaneous error with this approach. Trends in the flux error are also identified, in particular an equator-to-pole trend in the flux bias. Given the importance of satellite measurements for determining heat transport from equator to pole, this consistent bias should be kept in mind, and efforts should be made to reduce it in the future.																	0894-8763						2001	40	12					2144	2161		10.1175/1520-0450(2001)040<2144:SFFSMR>2.0.CO;2								WOS:000172363600004

The regional geology, emphasizing the stratigraphy of a portion of the TCMC within the area between Arcelia and Teloloapan is presented. Stratigraphic relationships with units in adjacent areas are also described. The base of the stratigraphic section is a chlorite grade metamorphic sequence that includes the Taxco Schist, the Roca Verde Taxco Viejo Formation, and the Almoloya Phyllite Formation. These metamorphic units, as thick as 2.7 km, are covered disconformably by a sedimentary sequence, 2.9 km thick, composed of the Cretaceous marine Pochote, Morelos, and Mexcala Formations, as well as undifferentiated Tertiary continental red beds and volcanic rocks. The geology may be explained as the evolution of Mesozoic volcanic and sedimentary environments developed upon attenuated continental crust.

The data come from Landsat thematic mapper. (TM) observations, while Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are used to aid the interpretation of the observations and to examine sensitivity to various factors. We show that shortwave radiative processes produce consistent signatures in power spectra and autocorrelation functions. Power spectra take a variety of shapes not shown or explained in previous observational studies. We demonstrate that TM spectra call potentially be affected by radiative "roughening" at intermediate, scales (similar to 1-5 km) and radiative "smoothing" at small scales (<1 km). These processes are wavelength-dependent, with systematic differences between conservative (for cloud droplets) TM band 4 (similar to 0.8 mu m) and absorbing band 7 (similar to 2.2 mu m). Band 7 exhibits moro roughening and less smoothing than band 4 and faster decrease in autocorrelation. Roughening is more prevalent at large solar zenith angles due to optical and/or geometrical side illumination and shadowing. MC spectra illustrate that scale invariant optical depth fields can produce complex power spectra that take a variety of shapes under different conditions. Radiative roughening increases with decreasing single scattering albedo and increasing solar zenith angle (as in the observations). For low solar zenith angles, there is a clear shift in the radiative smoothing scale to smaller values as droplet absorption increases. Power spectra also show stronger decorrelations between optical depth and reflectivity when cloud top variations are more pronounced. Finally, it is shown that power spectral analysis is a useful tool for evaluating the skill of novel optical depth retrieval techniques in removing three-dimensional radiative effects. New techniques using inverse nonlocal independent pixel approximation and normalized difference of nadir reflectivity yield optical depth fields which better match the scale-by-scale variability of the true optical depth field.

J	Roux, SG; Arneodo, A; Decoster, N				Roux, SG; Arneodo, A; Decoster, N			A wavelet-based method for multifractal image analysis. III. Applications to high-resolution satellite images of cloud structure	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL B												We apply the 2D wavelet transform modulus maxima (WTMM) method to high-resolution LANDSAT satellite images of cloudy scenes. The computation of the tau(q) and D(h) multifractal spectra for both the optical depth and the radiance fields confirms the relevance of the multifractal description to account for the intermittent nature of marine stratocumulus clouds. When assisting the 2D WTMM method by the wavelet based deconvolution method designed to compute the self-similarity kernel, we show that our numerical tools are very efficient to disentangle the anisotropic texture induced by the presence of convective rolls from the background radiance fluctuations which are likely to display isotropic scale invariance. Moreover, this analysis reveals that with the available set of experimental data, there is no way to discriminate between various phenomenological cascade models recently proposed to account fur intermittency and their log-normal approximations. When further investigating the "two-point" space-scale correlation functions, we bring definite proof of the existence of an underlying multiplicative structure from an "integral" coarsest scale which is given by the characteristic width of the convective patterns. We emphasize the log-normal random W-cascade model on separable wavelet orthogonal basis introduced in paper II (N. Decoster, S.G. Roux, A. Ameodo, Fur. Phys. J.

This article presents a method for deriving the bottom albedo from the TM in coastal waters. Our study of historical TM images shows degradation of the sensor through time. Pattern noise in the imagery in Bands 2 and 3 was analyzed and removed using a combination of Fourier filtering and edge-detection techniques. Noise was first examined over clear and deep nearby oceanic waters, and the filter algorithms developed there were applied to the entire image. To estimate water-leaving radiance from the satellite sensor, Rayleigh and aerosol path radiance were removed. Radiance due to aerosol scattering was calculated for offshore pixels assuming a marine aerosol type, and it was removed as a constant from the entire scene. The TM sensor calibration was validated by comparing water-leaving radiance values over the clear waters of the Florida current with known, normalized water-leaving radiance values. Corrections for water path radiance and water-column attenuation of bottom-reflected radiance were made for regions of known depth, allowing the bottom albedo and vegetative pixel fraction to be determined for shallow reef areas in the Florida Keys.

J	Testa, V; Bosence, DWJ				Testa, V; Bosence, DWJ			Physical and biological controls on the formation of carbonate and siliciclastic bedforms on the north-east Brazilian shelf	SEDIMENTOLOGY												The continental shelf of the State of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil, is an open shelf area located 5 degrees S and 35 degrees W. It is influenced by strong oceanic and wind-driven currents, fair weather, 1.5-m-high waves and a mesotidal regime. This work focuses on the character and the controls on the development of suites of carbonate and siliciclastic bedforms, based on Landsat TM image analysis and extensive ground-truth (diving) investigations. Large-scale bedforms consist of: (i) bioclastic (mainly coralline algae and Halimeda) sand ribbons (5-10 km long, 50-600 m wide) parallel to the shoreline; and (ii) very large transverse siliciclastic dunes (3.4 km long on average, 840 m spacing and 3-8 m high), with troughs that grade rapidly into carbonate sands and gravels. Wave ripples are superposed on all large-scale bedforms, and indicate an onshore shelf sediment transport normal to the main sediment transport direction. The occurrence of these large-scale bedforms is primarily determined by the northwesterly flowing residual oceanic and tidal currents, resulting mainly in coast-parallel transport. Models of shelf bedform formation predict sand ribbons to occur in higher energy settings rather than in large dunes. However, in the study area, sand ribbons occur in an area of coarse, low-density and easily transportable bioclastic sands and gravels compared with the very large transverse dunes in an offshore area that is composed of denser medium-grained siliciclastic sands. It suggests that the availability of different sediment types is likely to exert an influence on the nature of the bedforms generated. The offshore sand supply is time limited and originates from sea floor erosion of sandstones of former sea-level lowstands. The trough areas of both sand ribbons and very large transverse dunes comprise coarse calcareous alg;al gravels that support benthic communities of variable maturity. Diverse mature communities result in sediment stabilization through branching algal growth and binding that is thought to modify the morphology of dunes and sand ribbons. The occurrence and the nature of the bedforms is controlled by their hydrodynamic setting, by grain composition that reflects the geological history of the area and by the carbonate-producing benthic marine communities that inhabit the trough areas.																	0037-0746					APR	1999	46	2					279	301		10.1046/j.1365-3091.1999.00213.x								WOS:000080189400004

Reflectivity and Doppler velocity measurements were obtained in vertical and horizontal planes that extend from the flight lines. Data from three consecutive days were used to examine echo structure and microphysics characteristics. The clouds appeared horizontally homogeneous and light drizzle reached the surface in all three cases. Radar reflectivity is dominated by drizzle drops over the lower two-thirds to four-fifths of the clouds and by cloud droplets above that. Cells with above-average drizzle concentrations exist in all cases and exhibit a large range of sizes. The cells have irregular horizontal cross sections but occur with a dominant spacing that is roughly 1.2-1.5 times the depth of the cloud layer. Doppler velocities in the vertical are downward in all but a very small fraction of the cloud volumes. The cross correlation between reflectivity and vertical Doppler velocity changes sign at or below the midpoint of the cloud, indicating that in the upper parts of the clouds above-average reflectivities are associated with smaller downward velocities. This correlation and related observations are interpreted as the combined results of upward transport of drizzle drops and of downward motion of regions diluted by entrainment. The in situ measurements support these conclusions.																	0022-4928					DEC 15	1998	55	24					3540	3564		10.1175/1520-0469(1998)055<3540:FSAMOC>2.0.CO;2								WOS:000077690600002						
J	Moss, SJ				Moss, SJ			Embaluh group turbidites in Kalimantan: evolution of a remnant oceanic basin in Borneo during the Late Cretaceous to Palaeogene	JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY												Turbidites crop out in large parts of NW Borneo, including Kalimantan and Sarawak. The strata predominantly comprise the Embaluh Group in Kalimantan and lateral equivalents the Rajang Group in Sarawak (collectively known as the Rajang-Embaluh Group). Previous interpretation of these rocks as the product of deep marine deposition and deformation as part of an accretionary prism during Late Cretaceous to Palaeogene subduction implies south-dipping thrusts, northward stratigraphic younging, the existence of a complete are to trench system, and significant deformation and metamorphism of the turbidites. However new fieldwork described here established consistent southward stratigraphic younging in Kalimantan, no evidence for southward-dipping thrusts and a lack of metamorphism and associated accretionary complex-related deformation features. Furthermore all available palaeontological and radiometric age data indicate that deposition of the bulk of the Rajang-Embaluh Group postdates in-board subduction-related magmatism and thus a complete arc-trench system cannot be demonstrated. Consequently the Rajang-Embaluh Group turbidites are re-interpreted as having Formed in either a post-collisional foreland basin or a remnant ocean basin. The lack of a identifiable mountain belt and linked thrust system, and probable oceanic affinity of crust beneath the Rajang-Embaluh Group basin favour the latter interpretation. Borneo occupies a pivotal position within southeast Asia. This new model of a remnant oceanic basin setting for extensive turbidite units of Borneo therefore has far-reaching implications for the tectonic evolution of Borneo, the South China Sea and SE Asia. The new model is compared with older, Palaeozoic orogenic belts which also contain thick turbidites sequences.																	0016-7649					MAY	1998	155		3				509	524		10.1144/gsjgs.155.3.0509								WOS:000073705100010

Here we present an account of one of the first coral reef applications. The CASI was flown over reefs of the Turks and Caicos Islands (British West Indies) and set to view 1 m pixels in 8 spectral bands. In addition, reef habitats were sampled in situ by visual assessment of percent cover in 1 m quadrats. Seagrass standing crop was assessed using a calibrated visual scale. Benthic habitats were classified using hierarchical cluster and similarity percentage analyses of the field survey data. Two levels of habitat discrimination were assessed: a coarse level (corals, algae, sand, seagrass) and a fine level which included nine reef habitats. Overall accuracies of CASI-derived habitat maps were 89% and 81% for coarse and fine levels of habitat discrimination, respectively. Accuracies were greatest once CASI data had been processed to compensate for variations in depth and edited to take account of generic patterns of reef distribution. These overall accuracies were significantly (P < 0.001) better than those obtained from satellite imagery of the same site (Landsat MSS, Landsat TM, SPOT XS, SPOT Pan, merged Landsat TM/SPOT Pan). Results from CASI were also significantly better than those from interpretation of 1:10 000 colour aerial photographs of reefs in Anguilla (Sheppard et al. 1995). However, the studies may not have been entirely com parable due to a disparity in the areas mapped.

Using Landsat TM visible bands, an iterative digital image classification is used to delineate the major reef flat zones. In addition, TM band 4 is used to assist in the identification of algal growth, showing that this band can successfully separate substrate types up to a depth of 35 cm in clear calm water.

We also address the inverse problem of cloud optical depth retrieval from satellite data, showing how NIPA can be used to overcome the limitations of current IPA-based methods at small scales.

J	Barker, HW; Wielicki, BA				Barker, HW; Wielicki, BA			Parameterizing grid-averaged longwave fluxes for inhomogeneous marine boundary layer clouds	JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES												This paper examines the relative impacts on grid-averaged longwave flux transmittance (emittance) for marine boundary layer (MEL) cloud fields arising from horizontal variability of optical depth tau and cloud sides. First, using fields of Landsat-inferred tau and a Monte Carlo photon transport algorithm, it is demonstrated that mean all-sky transmittances for 3D variable MBL clouds can be computed accurately by the conventional method of linearly weighting clear and cloudy transmittances by their respective sky fractions. Then, the approximations of decoupling cloud and radiative properties and assuming independent columns are shown to be adequate for computation of mean flux transmittance. Since real clouds have nonzero geometric thicknesses, cloud fractions (A) over cap(c) presented to isotropic beams usually exceed the more familiar vertically projected cloud fractions A(c). It is shown, however, that when A(c) less than or similar to 0.9, biases for all-sky transmittance stemming from use of A(c) as opposed to (A) over cap(c) are roughly 2-5 times smaller than, and opposite in sign to, biases due to neglect of horizontal variability of tau. By neglecting variable tau, all-sky transmittances are underestimated often by more than 0.1 for A(c) near 0.75 and this translates into relative errors that can exceed 40% (corresponding errors for all-sky emittance are about 20% for most values of A(c)). Thus, priority should be given to development of general circulation model (GCM) parameterizations that account for the effects of horizontal variations in unresolved tau, effects of cloud sides are of secondary importance. On this note, an efficient stochastic model for computing grid-averaged cloudy-sky flux transmittances is furnished that assumes that distributions of tau, for regions comparable in size to GCM grid cells, can be described adequately by gamma distribution functions. While the plane-parallel, homogeneous model underestimates cloud transmittance by about an order of magnitude when 3D variable cloud transmittances are less than or similar to 0.2 and by similar to 20% to 100% otherwise, the stochastic model reduces these biases often by more than 80%.																	0022-4928					DEC 15	1997	54	24					2785	2798		10.1175/1520-0469(1997)054<2785:PGALFF>2.0.CO;2								WOS:000071211200001

The radiative properties of these clouds depend upon the cloud fraction and the horizontal variability of liquid water path within patches of unbroken cloud. A simple statistical model for describing the probability distributions of liquid water path and cloud fraction in low clouds has been developed. The model is shown to reproduce realistically the diurnal cycle in the cloud fraction and horizontal inhomogeneity of marine stratocumulus. Further, the model produces realistic statistics for the horizontal variability of liquid water path within boundary layer clouds. The modeled distributions of cloud liquid water path depend upon the cloud fraction, similar to Landsat retrievals. The results are discussed in the context of improving the representation of boundary layer clouds in large-scale models.																	2169-897X	2169-8996				JUN 27	1997	102	D12					13517	13525		10.1029/97JD00261								WOS:A1997XH19600011						
J	Chambers, LH; Wielicki, BA; Evans, KF				Chambers, LH; Wielicki, BA; Evans, KF			Accuracy of the independent pixel approximation for satellite estimates of oceanic boundary layer cloud optical depth	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												A theoretical study has been conducted on the effects of cloud horizontal inhomogeneity on the retrieval of optical depth by remote sensing of visible reflectance. Forty-five Landsat scenes of oceanic boundary layer clouds provide a sampling of real cloud fields, including trade cumulus, open and closed cell broken stratocumulus, and solid stratocumulus. The spherical harmonic discrete ordinate method (SHDOM) radiative transfer model is used to calculate two-dimensional reflectances from subsampled cloud strips representing the Landsat scenes. The independent pixel approximation (IPA) is used to retrieve optical depth for comparison to the original input. Results for tau(IPA) versus tau(ref) are presented on scales from the Landsat pixel scale (28.5 m) to an imager pixel scale (6 km) to near mesoscale (60 km). The random error decreases as the averaging scale increases, but error due to inhomogeneity remains. At the 60 km scale the average error is about 6% for high Sun, 2% for low Sun. Individual scenes, however, have retrieved optical depth errors as high as 45% due to horizontal radiative transport. The ability to retrieve higher statistical moments of the frequency distribution of optical depth is also assessed. Sigma, (sigma), the standard deviation of tau, is retrieved quite well up to a point, then is underestimated due to the smoothing effect of horizontal radiative transport. The gamma function parameter nu, another measure of the width of the tau frequency distribution, is retrieved quite well over a wide range but with a systematic bias which varies with solar zenith angle, again due to horizontal radiative transport. A method is sought to reduce the optical depth retrieval error using a simple correction based on remotely sensed cloud properties. Of those considered, cloud physical aspect ratio (computed here from one possible relation which depends on properties obtainable from remote sensing) is found to be the most effective correction parameter. The aspect ratio correction reduces the retrieved optical depth bias error by 50 to 100% and the RMS error by 20 to 50%. Correction coefficients are presented at three solar zenith angles. This work is limited by its consideration of only single-level marine boundary layer clouds, assumptions of conservative scattering, constant cloud droplet size, no gas absorption or surface reflectance, and restriction to two-dimensional radiative transport. Future work will attempt to remove some of these limitations. The Landsat data used are also limited due to radiative smoothing.																	2169-897X					JAN 27	1997	102	D2					1779	1794		10.1029/96JD02995								WOS:A1997WE65000007

The geometry and chronology of the Cenozoic structures linked to the opening of this basin were studied in detail in Da Nang area (central Vietnam). An integrated onshore and offshore study was conducted, combining onland Landsat-Spot imagery interpretation and fracture analysis with marine geophysical data collected during the 1993 Ponaga cruise (R/V L'Atalante) and completed by previously unpublished industrial data. On land, two superposed fault sets were observed on remote sensing data: large N140 degrees E trending strike-slip faults are observed to link with E-W trending normal faults, and major N-S trending strike-slip faults are connected to N050 degrees E faults. At this scale of observation, no significant displacement can be demonstrated along these two strike-slip fault systems which show a cross-cutting map geometry without visible offset. The data collected offshore demonstrate that the N-S fault pattern is developed strongly, but there is no evidence of major N140 degrees E fault orientations. Important crustal extension on shallow-dipping fault planes striking N050 degrees E and connected to the N-S strike-slip faults, is compatible with dextral motion along these N-S faults. The discrepancy between the amount of motion observed onshore and offshore may be explained by the presence of a major N-S trending shear zone along the Vietnam margin. This shear zone is located in the region of the N-S Qui Nhon ridge, which is blanketed by Middle Miocene carbonates. Dextral motion along this shear zone became insignificant regionally during the late early Miocene (around 20 Ma), when carbonates deposition started. We suggest that central Vietnam records two distinct, and partly coeval, events of the strike-slip faulting that have contributed to the opening of the south China Sea: sinistral NW shear, then dextral N-S shear south of Hainan.

The present study is focused on the use of Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) data as a powerful and efficient means for providing information about a case of coastal vegetation deterioration in Tuscany. This phenomenon, dating back about twenty-five years ago, mainly concerns the pine plantation which covers the plain south of the outlet of the Ombrone riper. In the last forty years this zone has also been affected by strong coastal erosion. The almost contemporaneous occurrence of the two phenomena, as well as the geographical distribution of the disease and some morpho-physiological features of the injured plants, has led to the formulation of an hypothesis which identifies the infiltration of marine salt water into the phreatic surface below the pine wood as the main cause of the deterioration. In this context, TM data not only provide precise and up-to-date information about the spatial distribution of the disease, but also give a straightforward means for quantitatively assessing vegetation conditions on a local scale (30-50 m.). The latter parameter has been related to the likely causative agent of the injury, i.e., the presence of salt water in the pine wood son. The results of the investigation confirm the working hypothesis and testify to the actual utility of high resolution satellite data in these situations.																	0749-0208					WIN	1996	12	1					103	111										WOS:A1996TW33400011

Seven spectral stratigraphic units, each of which corresponds to a distinct lithostratigraphic unit, were delineated. Five consist of terrestrial Upper Cretaceous and Tertiary siliciclastic, volcanic, and volcaniclastic rocks; one contains Mesozoic marine rocks; and one corresponds to Quaternary alluvium. A previously undocumented NNW-trending Tertiary graben was identified in which 2,000 m of lower Tertiary volcanic rocks accumulated, suggesting volcanism coeval with graben subsidence during WSW-ENE regional extension in the early Tertiary Overlap of the western-graben bounding fault by slightly younger lower Tertiary rocks suggests subsidence ended by the close of the early Tertiary. Continued volcanism within the graben during the late Tertiary indicates a long-lived volcanic source region within the subsurface of the NNW-trending structure and localization of younger magmatic activity within a pre-existing zone of crustal weakness.																	0099-1112					DEC	1996	62	12					1371	1378										WOS:A1996VV45400014						
J	Boss, SK				Boss, SK			Digital shaded relief image of a carbonate platform (northern Great Bahama Bank): Scenery seen and unseen	GEOLOGY												A mosaic image of the northern Great Bahama Bank was created from separate gray-scale Landsat images using photo-editing and image analysis software that is commercially available for desktop computers, Measurements of pixel gray levels (relative scale from 0 to 255 referred to as digital number, DN) on the mosaic image were compared to bank-top bathymetry (determined from a network of single-channel, high-resolution seismic profiles), bottom type (coarse sand, sandy mud, barren rock, or reef determined from seismic profiles and diver observations), and vegetative cover (presence and/or absence and relative density of the marine angiosperm Thalassia testudinum determined from diver observations), Results of these analyses indicate that bank-top bathymetry is a primary control on observed pixel DN, bottom type is a secondary control on pixel DN, and vegetative cover is a tertiary influence on pixel DN, Consequently, processing of the gray-scale Landsat mosaic with a directional gradient edge-detection filter generated a physiographic shaded relief image resembling bank-top bathymetric patterns related to submerged physiographic features across the platform, The visibility of submerged karst landforms, Pleistocene eolianite ridges, islands, and possible paleo drainage patterns created during sea-level lowstands is significantly enhanced on processed images relative to the original mosaic, Bank-margin ooid shoals, platform interior sand bodies, reef edifices, and bidirectional sand waves are features resulting from Holocene carbonate deposition that are also more clearly visible on the new physiographic images, Combined with observational data (single-channel, high-resolution Seismic profiles, bottom observations by SCUBA divers, sediment and rock cores) across the northern Great Bahama Bank, these physiographic images facilitate comprehension of areal relations among antecedent platform topography, physical processes, and ensuing depositional patterns during sea-level rise.																	0091-7613					NOV	1996	24	11					985	988		10.1130/0091-7613(1996)024<0985:DSRIOA>2.3.CO;2								WOS:A1996VW09800006						
J	Barker, HW; Wielicki, BA; Parker, L				Barker, HW; Wielicki, BA; Parker, L			A parameterization for computing grid-averaged solar fluxes for inhomogeneous marine boundary layer clouds .2. Validation using satellite data	JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES												The independent pixel approximation (IPA) is one of the simplest methods of computing solar radiative fluxes for inhomogeneous clouds. It claims that if p(tau) is a normalized probability density function for cloud optical depth tau and R(pp)(tau) is plane-parallel, homogeneous (PPH) albedo, mean cloud albedo can be approximated by integrating p(tau)R(pp)(tau) over all tau. The purpose of this study is to assess the ability of the gamma distribution function to represent p(tau) for marine boundary layer clouds and to examine the accuracy of the ensuing gamma IPA albedos. In a separate study, pixel values of tau were inferred from high spatial resolution Landsat imagery of marine boundary layer clouds. The present study utilizes 45 images, each measuring (58 km)(2). For each image, a density function p(obs)(tau) is estimated, and, using the mean <(tau)over bar> and variance of tau, a corresponding truncated gamma distribution function p(gamma)(tau) is defined. For a diverse range of clouds, p(gamma)(tau) usually approximate p(obs)(tau) well. The best results are for overcast stratocumulus and small, broken cumulus, while the worst results are for streets of moderately thick cumulus observed at relatively large solar zenith angles. After both p(obs)(tau) and corresponding p(gamma)(tau) are filtered through the IPA; however, resulting solar zenith angle dependent and spherical albedos often agree to well within 5%, regardless of cloud type. Furthermore, disparities between IPA albedos using p(obs)(7) and p(gamma)(tau) are roughly 10 times smaller than disparities between IPA albedos using p(obs)(tau) and corresponding PPH albedos [R(pp)(<(tau)over bar>)]. Thus, for marine boundary layer clouds, the gamma IPA can be expected to remove most of the PPH bias currently present in GCMs. A simple parameterization, dependent on cloud fraction, is furnished that may enable the gamma IPA to be used in GCMs.																	0022-4928					AUG 15	1996	53	16					2304	2316		10.1175/1520-0469(1996)053<2304:APFCGA>2.0.CO;2								WOS:A1996VE23800002

Collection of marine water samples in the Thane creek region has been synchronised with the satellite passes of Landsat. The water samples were analysed for turbidity, an important physical pollution parameter. An attempt has been made to establish the relationship between the real time values of the marine pollution parameter (turbidity in this case) analysed in the laboratory and the digital counts (function of surface radiance) from the remotely sensed data using statistical technique. A two step approach has been followed to relate the TM data with the marine pollution parameter. The advantage df this methodology in detection and measurement of turbidity is discussed.																	0379-5136					JUN	1996	25	2					103	108										WOS:A1996UN03200005						
J	Green, EP; Mumby, PJ; Edwards, AJ; Clark, CD				Green, EP; Mumby, PJ; Edwards, AJ; Clark, CD			A review of remote sensing for the assessment and management of tropical coastal resources	COASTAL MANAGEMENT												This article reviews applications of remote sensing to the assessment of tropical coastal resources. These applications ave discussed in the context of specific management objectives and sensors used. Remote sensing remains the only way to obtain synoptic data for large coastal areas uniformly in time and space, repeatedly and nonintrusively. Routine applications to tropical coastal management include the mapping of littoral and shallow marine habitats, change detection, bathymetry mapping, and the study of suspended sediment plumes and coastal currents. The case studies reviewed suggest that wider use of remote sensing in tropical coastal zone management is limited by (1) factors that affect data availability, such as cloud cover and sensor specification; and (2) the problems that decision makers face in selecting a remote sensing technique suitable to their project objectives. These problems arise from the difficulty in comparing the capabilities of different sensors and the limited amount of published information available on practical considerations, such as cost-effectiveness and accuracy assessments. The latter are essential if management decisions are to be based upon the results.

J	BUSHARA, MN				BUSHARA, MN			SUBSURFACE STRUCTURE OF THE EASTERN EDGE OF THE ZAGROS BASIN AS INFERRED FROM GRAVITY AND SATELLITE DATA	AAPG BULLETIN-AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF PETROLEUM GEOLOGISTS												A data set of 10,505 points of land gravity measurements from southeast Iran obtained from the Bureau Gravimetrique International, combined with Landsat imagery, was used to investigate crustal and Cenozoic lithospheric structure. Interpretation of the Bouguer anomalies reveals three primary structural features. The Zagros Mountain belt is characterized by a progressive decrease in gravity values from -70 mGal near the Persian Gulf to -160 mGal over the suture zone between the Arabian margin and-central Iran crustal blocks. The second feature is marked by a backward-L-shaped pair of anomalies that extends from the eastern peripheries of the Zagros basin and wraps around southern Iranian shores. These 15- to 20-km-deep source anomalies, with amplitudes of as much as 10 mGal, are interpreted as intrabasement intrusions demarcating an ancient rift axis. The shallow (6-8 km) east-west-trending anomalies are perhaps interbasement uplifts bordered by reverse faults. The third structure, observed on both gravity and Landsat displays, a north-striking eastward-facing topographic escarpment, has a gravity gradient of 0.85 mGal/km, and is right laterally offset approximately 100 km by the Zagros main recent fault. On Landsat, this escarpment is manifest by a system of north-trending faults that seem to diverge into a horsetail pattern toward the east, and by a set of north-trending dike swarms that cut Jurassic volcano-sedimentary rocks. It separates two distinct structural and sedimentary styles, the Zagros foreland basin anticlines of shallow marine Precambrian to Pliocene rocks on the west and the Makran deep-water Eocene flysch belt on the east. A comparison of gravity features with surface structures on Thematic Mapper and Landsat Multispectral Scanner imagery indicates that a northeast-trending fault system is the result of post-Miocene pervasive transpressive stress coupled with clockwise rotation of underlying basement blocks following the collision of Arabia and Iran. Accommodation structures such as forced folds and ''rabbit-ear'' anticlines may develop over and on the flanks of the basement blocks, providing remigration and trapping mechanisms for new oil and gas plays.																	0149-1423					SEP	1995	79	9					1259	1274										WOS:A1995RT22300002

The first part of the paper deals with the evaluation of remote sensing images (SPOT, Landsat Thematic Mapper and ERS-1 radar). The availability of the right images with respect to low tide conditions is discussed. Well-established classifications are used for both visible and radar images, which produce mainly geomorphological information: coastline, sediments, vegetation. Living resources at risk are compiled mostly out of ancillary data, i.e., maps and reports. These two types of information lead to ranking the shoreline in terms of its ecological sensitivity. Man-made objects and human activities are also incorporated. After collecting all relevant data, we examine in a second part how to merge them and produce environmental sensitivity maps, using both CAD (Computer Assisted Design) and GIS (Geographic Information Systems) tools.																	0143-1161					JAN 10	1995	16	1					3	15		10.1080/01431169508954368								WOS:A1995QE99000001

False color composites generated from Landsat Thematic Mapper and SPOT image data, digital elevation models derived from stereophotogrammetric analysis of SPOT data, and field observations document that a approximately 10-km-wide swath inland from the coast is covered in many places with coalescing alluvial fans of Quaternary age. Wadis cutting through the fans exhibit several pairs of fluvial terraces, and wadi walls expose alluvium interbedded with coralline limestone deposits. three distinct coral terrace are evident along the coastline. Climatic, eustatic, and tectonic uplift controls on the overall system were simulated using a cellular automata algorithm with die following characteristics: (1) uplift as a function of position and time, as defined by the elevations and ages of corals; (2) climatic variations driven by insolation changes associated with Milankovitch cycles; (3) sea level fluctuations based on U/rh ages of coral terraces and eustatic data; and (4) parameterized fluvial erosion and deposition. Results imply that the fans and coralline limestones were generated in a setting in which the tectonic uplift rate decreased over the Quaternary to negligible values at present. Coralline limestones formed during eustatic highstands when alluvium was trapped upstream and wadis filled with debris. During lowstands, wadis cut into sedimentary deposits; coupled with continuing uplift, fans were dissected, leaving remnant surfaces, and wadirelated terraces were generated by down cutting. Only landforms from the past three to four eustatic sea level cycles (i.e., approximately 300 to 400 kyr) are likely to have survived erosion and deposition associated with fluvial processes.

J	ZAINAL, AJM				ZAINAL, AJM			NEW TECHNIQUE FOR ENHANCING THE DETECTION AND CLASSIFICATION OF SHALLOW MARINE HABITATS	MARINE TECHNOLOGY SOCIETY JOURNAL												A new method is described for enhancing the visual interpretation and quantitative analysis of shallow marine habitats. The method is based on the principle of exploiting the critical depth range of each habitat using a Degital Elevation Model (DEM) generated from a bathymetric map of the study area. The DEM is used as an input into a mathematical model derived by regressing known depth data with their thematic mapper (TM) spectral values over the dominating depth-variable sandy substrate. The resulting depth reflectance image is then combined with the TM bands to minimize the effect of depth variation within the image. The new method proved to be effective for enhancing the visual interpretation of submerged habitats and particularly sea-grass beds off the coast of Bahrain which could not be detected with conventional image processing techniques. The technique also proved to be useful for enhancing areas of high suspended sediments in the water. In the quantitative analysis stage, the technique was found to increase the final classification accuracy of the subscene substantially. The slope and aspect variation of the topography caused confusion in classification between some of the habitats. Ways of improving the technique are suggested for future investigations.																	0025-3324					SUM	1994	28	2					68	77										WOS:A1994PQ19700010

The faults are evident in disturbed outcrops along the river and in subtle lineaments revealed in aerial photographs and Landsat imagery in the surrounding marshland topography. Slumping of large blocks from a reef crest in Silurian time and stratigraphic relationships within the Hudson Basin indicate a major episode of movement in late Llandovery time. Movements on the fault set have been traced back to Proterozoic time and, to affect the present subdued topography recently emerged from marine inundation, must have been renewed in rapid recent postglacial uplift of this area.																	0008-4077	1480-3313				AUG	1993	30	8					1668	1673		10.1139/e93-145								WOS:A1993MF34100012

The most rapid emissions of >500 nmol m-2 h-1 occurred in red mangrove-dominated sites that were adjacent to open seawater and contained numerous crab burrows. Poorly drained red mangrove sites exhibited lower fluxes of approximately 60 nmol m-2 h-1 which were similar to fluxes from the black mangrove areas which dominated the marine-influenced wetland sites in the Everglades. DMS was the dominant organo-S gas emitted especially in the freshwater areas. Spectral data from a scene from the Landsat thematic mapper were used to map habitats in the Everglades. Six vegetation categories were delineated using geographical information system software and S gas emissions were extrapolated for the entire Everglades National Park. The black mangrove-dominated areas accounted for the largest portion of S gas emissions to the area. The large area extent of the saw grass communities (42%) accounted for approximately 24% of the total S emissions.

The exclusive use of traditional surveying tools may not be practical for monitoring large, remote, or rapidly changing areas. This paper investigates the utility of multispectral Landsat Thematic Mapper satellite data for documenting changes to a Caribbean coastal zone using the change vector analysis processing technique. The area of study was the coastal region near the village of Buen Hombre on the north coast of the Dominican Republic. The primary habitats of interest were the intertidal mangrove forests, and the shallow water seagrasses, macroalgae, and coral reefs. The change vector analysis technique uses any number of spectral bands from multidate satellite data to produce change images that yield information about both the magnitude and direction of differences in pixel values (which are proportional to radiance). The final products were created by appending color-coded change pixels onto a black-and-white base map. The advantages and limitations of the technique for coastal inventories are discussed.																	0099-1112					MAR	1993	59	3					381	384										WOS:A1993LC77500010

The raw data comprized several digital TM images acquired between 1985 and 1992 during different tidal conditions. Following pre-processing and registration to a digitized UTM marine chart, the image processing proceeded in two parts. In the first part, visual interpretation was employed using a combination of principal component and false color composites (FCCs) of the multi-temporal images to identify the changed areas. Then, and in conjunction with extensive field data, the changed areas between the two dates were identified. In the second part, post-classification comparison was employed in combination with digital elevation data to quantify the magnitude of habitat change in the identified areas. The spectral similarity between some of the submerged habitats and, in particular, between seagrass and deep water, and between seagrass, corals, and algae caused confusion in classification. However, it was found that the problems can be significantly reduced by subdividing the images around the change areas and then classifying each subscene independently after appropriate masking of deep water areas. The results indicated that between 1985 and 1992, an estimated total of 38,700 m2 of dense corals, 1.8 x 10(5) m2 of lower density corals, and 10.2 x 10(6) m2 of seagrass areas were lost. On the other hand, an increase of 4.3 x 10(5) m2 of algae (Sargassum) was detected in the study area near a large industrial outfall.																	0099-1112					MAR	1993	59	3					415	421										WOS:A1993LC77500015						
J	KAMAL, AF				KAMAL, AF			PHOTOINTERPRETATION OF PLEISTOCENE MEDITERRANEAN RIDGES SOUTH-WEST OF ALEXANDRIA	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The Pleistocene ridges south-west of Alexandria are of marine origin and represent the ancient shoreline of the former sea levels. Several authors have described the nature, origin and geomorphology of the Pleistocene ridges. The objective is to delineate these ridges using aerial photomosaics at 1:100 000 scale and a Landsat image at 1:250 000 scale. The area is covered by beach sands in the northern part and consolidated limestone forming coastal ridges southwards. The lowlands between the ridges are occupied by marshes, lagoons or mixtures of clay and lime materials. Plant cover occurs in the central part. The different ridges recognized photogeologically are eight ridges and the foreshore ridges are more distinct than those of the backshore. Owing to the presence of plant cover, some ridges appear as faint lines. The ridges and lowlands appear on photomosaics with tonal contrast where successive light and dark toned areas can be easily identified. The interpreted ridges were correlated with those in the topographic map with the same scale and covering the same area. It was found that a number of these ridges follow the configuration of the relief where they are represented by high peaks. Ridges appear as elongated alignments nearly parallel with the Mediterranean Sea shore with a general trend NE-SW. The presence of some minerals such as augite and the size of their grains indicate that the sea currents and prevailing wind directions were coming mainly from the east or north-east whereas the reverse case occurs nowadays. Photointerpretation indicated the presence of a number of fractures trending NW-SE, dissecting the ridges in the northern part of the area.																	0143-1161					OCT	1991	12	10					2109	2116		10.1080/01431169108955239								WOS:A1991GH73600007
